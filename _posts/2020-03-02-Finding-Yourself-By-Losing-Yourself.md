<p><b>William:</b> Alright. So what takes up most of your
time these days?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, working. Writing: working on my fourth book
currently. And in-between that preaching,
singing and playing. So pretty much my
time I have to really be disciplined in
taking advantage of the downtime that I have.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And what entails playing?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> I'm a
keyboardist.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yes. I saw something about musician.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> I'm
a keyboardist and a drummer. But my love
is for the keyboard. When people call me
to different services, I mean I played
for funerals, weddings, church services,
conferences, I'm normally being asked
to play the keyboard.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, music can
have a lot of influence when you're
preaching,
or just trying to connect in general,
isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Absolutely, even when I recently...
I've been going around, speaking at
Rotary clubs. And so this one particular
club that I went to, I opened up with a
song. So needless to say when I opened up
with the song, number one I got their
attention, and basically they were
focused on what I had to say afterwards,
because the song that I sung coincided
with the presentation that I had
presenting.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, it can set the mood, to
make people more ready for what you have
to say. That's great. So do you go around a
lot, preaching and speaking? Like what
radius are we talking?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> All over, as
far as Virginia. My desire is eventually
to come off my full-time job and just do
a speaking tour. My desire. And I believe
I'll be doing that between one to three
years.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Wow yeah. What keeps you going?
What inspires you to do this kind
of work?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> God inspired, simply God inspired.
He gives me an unction, or he gives me
direction. There's a scripture that says,
"You will hear the still small voice
saying 'This is the way. Walk in it.'" So I
always listen to that still small voice,
and that's how I'm able to do what I do.
Many people ask me, "How are you doing all
these things that you're doing?" And my
response to them is simply "I'm just
being obedient to what God has given me."
And a lot of times we try to pattern
ourselves after other people, but the
truth of the matter is God don't want you to
be like someone else. You have to be uniquely you.
It may seem quirky to you, it may seem
kind of off to you. But that could be the
thing that will set you apart from the
masses.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. I think it's natural
for people to emulate someone else. But
they can only be really happy and have a
purpose in their own life once they
realize what makes them them, like how
they can be their own person.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> What kind of path
have you gone to build this identity and
this purpose in your life? What led up to
this?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Really, self-acceptance is a big one.
Self-acceptance. As a child I never
really kind of fit in. I was just always
different, no matter how much I tried to
fit in. And it came to a point, maybe like
my early 20s, that I really began to
accept who Aleechea was, and not only
accept who I was, like who I was and
loved who I was. And so I made a resolve
that anybody that comes in my life, you
either going to accept me for all of me, or
you're not gonna accept me at all. And if
you don't accept me at all
then I'm okay with that. And so that's
what made me begin to go down this path.
Because a lot of times, and I say it all
the time, a lot of times we try to be
heroes to other people when we ourselves
need to be saved. And so if we work on us
and build ourselves up, build up our
character, build up our integrity, then we
can in turn reach out to the community.
Then we can in turn touch other people.
But it begins with us first, you know. And
a lot of times we look for people to
make us happy when the happiness starts
in you first.
