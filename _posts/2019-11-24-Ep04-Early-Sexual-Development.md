<p><b>William:</b> Hi. Welcome everybody. It's us again from
Who Am I? Podcast. Welcome to episode
4. We've had bigger breaks between the
episodes than we expected, but we just
keep going with whatever time and energy
we have available to us. We love
doing it, and we don't plan on going away
anytime soon. So keep tuned to this
channel and visit our homepage to see
whether there's anything new. Today Steve
and I would like to chat about the
development of human beings in the very
early stages, about ages two, three, four,
and what Freud has to say about that.
So Freud, one of his main topics was
about individual sexuality and how it
forms the roles that we take over from
our parents and how we become sexual
beings in society. And this isn't even
going to puberty, but just the very early
stages when we start building a personal
identity. And part of that identity is
whether we're a man or woman. Who we're
attracted to, and just who we want to be
like, I guess.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's a very good way of
summarizing the topic, I guess, where it's not
talked about much, really, I guess.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah it can be taboo.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's very taboo.
And sometimes
because I guess we don't see... only thinking
of puberty. When that happens obviously
we go through a transformation. But what
happens before that in terms of, as you
say, copying, identifying and all that
kind of things beforehand.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
