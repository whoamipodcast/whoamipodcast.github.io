For one year people have been like ultra-pasteurized milk:
* at ultra-high temperature anger for losing their jobs
* stored in their homes for ever in fear of being punished
* homogenised because they are all equally being controlled and exploited

The time has come for people to become more like fresh milk:
* if they are not put to use they turn sour
* they will not allow anyone to keep them from being rich in vitamins
* they do not require artificial intrusions to fight off micro-organisms
