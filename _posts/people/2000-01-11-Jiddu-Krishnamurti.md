Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986 and was an Indian philosopher who spoke in many public lectures, group discussions and with concerned individuals around the world. He met with many prominent religious leaders and scholars. In India he also met with many sanyasis and monks throughout his life. In the early 1960s, he made the acquaintance of physicist David Bohm, whose philosophical and scientific concerns regarding the essence of the physical world, and the psychological and sociological state of mankind, found parallels in Krishnamurti's philosophy.
