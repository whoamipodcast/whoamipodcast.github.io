<p><b>Steven:</b> We're both raised from early age in that
religion. I guess it's hard to know
where to begin, I guess, when discussing
how it affects your identity.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> One
of the first things that people mention
when I talk about my faith is "Oh,
you were brought up in that church. Okay
that explains why you're so devout",
rather than someone who... or I suppose in
their mind that are comparing that to
someone who
had a different upbringing, and then
later in life decides whether they want
to be religious or not. But I
reassure those people that, yes, even
though I have that in my childhood, I was
not forced to do anything. There are
certain pressures, like to serve as a
missionary or to get married to someone
that shares your faith. We can't
deny that. Just like just like there are
cultural pressures in any society. So
it's not really that foreign, I believe.
But, I was going to say: around the time I
was eight, and then again when I was 17,
18, 19 I certainly made up my own mind. I
put a lot of thought into it.
I made sure that no one is forcing me to
make certain decisions, so that I could
be certain that I want to commit to this
and I want to align my life by the
norms, the rules and recommendations that
come with living in this religious
group, but also just for myself, living
with a faith that there is a God, that
there is a father in heaven who watches
over us, who loves us and wants the best
for us. And the the ages 8 and 17, 18, 19
are so significant, you'll know this, Steve,
because at 8 you get the chance to be
baptized. So that is different from a lot
of other Christian churches: Our baptism
is by being dunked underwater for a
second, just like we believe Jesus was
when he lived on the earth, and that is
the earliest at age 8. It also depends on
your maturity and understanding of what
you're getting into. And then
when you are 19, and by now it's changed
to 18, you get the chance to serve as a
missionary, which is full-time service,
trying to find people out there who are
willing to listen to the message of the
gospel; and if they feel so
inclined they can also join the church
through baptism.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Opportunity to,
like all things I think in life, there
should be a choice. Like, I love
learning about politics. I love learning
about philosophy. And you know, to just
learn about them is to be taught, really,
to just look at yourself, I guess. But
that's, you know, why the missionaries go
out. They you go out, and they try to see
if anyone wants to actually learn about
what the LDS Church actually
teaches. And it's a lot. There's a lot
of stuff there, as a
Christian denomination. But there's so
many, I guess we call it teachings,
but like different ideals, different
perspectives. You know, we talk about
our upbringings in church. Yes,
I was baptized at eight. I didn't serve
a mission. I no longer attend. So I don't
go to church anymore at the moment.
I have had many positive, I guess
experiences, so many spiritual
experiences within the LDS church. And
I think that personally everyone
should experience all religion in
various different forms for at
least a few months, immersing yourself
in that culture. Because it gives you an idea of actually the
reality. Because so many assumptions are
made. Like earlier on, you spoke about
the "Oh, that explains
why you're so devout. And it's
because you're brought up in the church."
Well, that's a complete assumption.
Because usually it's the opposite: When
you're brought in the church
you feel suppressed. You feel like you
want to go and find out what else is out
there.
If you're like us and have a
self-evaluating personality, and it's a
critical personality way: you criticize
in a objective way your environment and
your experiences. So you're like "Well, is
this healthy? Is this spiritually,
psychologically good? Is this where I
want to be?" Because, quite frankly, we
personally hate being controlled.
It's in our nature as
humans in general, and I think us
too as individuals. We don't like to be
forced to do anything. It makes us
feel ill. It makes me feel ill. If I
tried to do something I don't want to do,
it has a weird weird effect
on me. And so yes, as a teenager growing
up, there was many points where I was
super involved in the church, super like
"Yes, I love the concepts that I'm being
taught here, you know, Jesus Christ's
concepts of love looking after each
other, service..." As we talked about,
different kinds of service. But just
trying to help people. I was helped by a
lot of people in the LDS Church, a lot of
kind and generous people which, I guess,
you'd call, you know, "Christians", who emulate
that mentality. And it really made me see...
I hadn't experienced that level.
We always talk about in
society where "Oh, you can be good without
religion, or you can be good without this."
And that is true. I know so
many more people outside the
church that are actually quite better
Christians than a lot people inside most
religions. But there are a lot of people
in those religions who are just taking
it to the next level, who are literally
like, if someone bullies them or like
criticize them, they just again turn the
other cheek. They have that next level.
Whereas most people's respons is to fight
back, or you know to make a scene about
it. Those little things: they don't seem
like a big deal but actually make a
difference in our personalities. And I
met a lot of people like that where just
was so lovely and kind of would do
anything for you. And that's because they
had tried to emulate... There are still
good people without it. They tried to
emulate a higher,
I guess, niceness and kindness. And that
made me want to to emulate that, to start off
with. How about you?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I haven't felt
bullying or control, again just certain
pressures. Hut I've always had
freedom to choose for myself whether I
wanted to follow a certain trend or keep
my distance from it. So there are lots of
programs outside of regular attendance
on Sundays that can help, just give you a
circle of friends or other support.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's
community isn't it, that word "community".
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. We try to have a community on
all levels, not just the spiritual. So it
depends on how much time you have. Some
people can't even find the time to
attend church on Sundays. And that's
understandable, because survival comes
first. We try to be there for each
other. Obviously some people have more
need than others to be supported, and so
it'll take time for them to reach a
stage in life where they can be there
for others more. But we all do things for
another in whatever way we can.
I mean sometimes it's just a phone call
to be there emotionally for someone, to
listen to them, to empathize. Sometimes
we physically serve by helping someone
move. That's a common one. That's a
popular one.
Or share secondhand stuff that someone
no longer needs and someone else needs.
So yeah, there's a lot of give-and-take.
And in that sense it's not much
different from other circles or
communities. But we also have that faith
in common.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> We'll talk about it
later, I mean religion
as a whole. But it's an
interesting psychological and spiritual
tool: to have that higher focus together
of a higher being to connect one another,
next level community, where it can
install even more passion and community
into a scenario. It can, and it can't. It can
divide. All things, as we
discussed in all the podcasts really,
come back to specifics. You know we're
making generalizations here. But the
generalization is that yeah everyone
tries to get along and be loving and
kind and actively loving and kind. I
think to me
that's the difference.
Because most people in society, at least in our
culture, we don't actively talk and try
to do, I guess, more positive things. We
just do them if we feel like doing them,
and if we don't if we don't. If something bad happens...
This is an example here. Let's say
someone's being mugged or whatever, it
might be the first time you've ever
experienced that. And so you don't know
how to respond, and you don't know how to do anything
about it.
Whereas
in I guess communities like a
church or anything like
Christian, again this is from my own
subjective knowledge, is that you're
trying to push, and trying to push to be
ready for those things. So you do
actually go and help
straightaway. The
Good Samaritan, I guess, the parable the
Samaritan is a prime example of the kindness of that, where two
opposing cultures, they actually hate
each other, and are at war. One of them goes
and helps the Samaritan. No sorry,
I'm forgetting the parable.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The Samaritan helps the jew.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
To demonstrate that actually we can be
prepared for these situations. We don't
have to act instictively. We can already
consciously be in our brains going "Okay.
If someone that I don't necessarily get on
with has been hurt I can go help." I think
that to me is a difference between what is
taught in general society and
what I've been taught in the LDS Church.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There is this network of support,
where we're not just supposed to be
there for one another in general, which
we try, but where each family or each
person is assigned a family to look
after
in whatever way they can. Sometimes it's
not easy to find ways to do that, but
ideally there is this tight-knit network.
In practice it doesn't always work out
so well. But we are actively encouraged
to serve one another teach one
another. That's something interesting
about our church: We all get a chance
to teach in front of the entire
congregation from time to time, maybe
twice a year. It depends on the size of
of the group. And also to teach one
another when we get together for these,
what should I call them, these supportive
private meetings in someone's household.
Or if you found a study
group, which are available usually for
teenagers and young adults.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's
how we met, isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> We met through one
of those teaching classes. We were both in
the Edinburgh area in Scotland.
It's how we kind of came to know each
other. How
how long ago is that now? It's got to be
like six, seven...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well, I was there for
about four years: 2011 to 2015.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There you go.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Teaching and study is a
big part of the religion.</p>
