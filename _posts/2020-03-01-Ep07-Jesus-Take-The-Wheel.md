<p><b>William:</b> Welcome, everybody. This is
whoamipodcast, and today for the first
time I have a guest to interview on the
show.
Her name is reverend Aleechea Pitts.
And it's my honor to interview her.
She is an author of several books. You
can find them on Amazon. That's where I
found them. And her home page is aleecheapitts.com .
You are a police chaplain in
New Jersey.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And I also saw something on the
homepage about being an adjunct
professor. Is that still current?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> No, that
is not still current.
