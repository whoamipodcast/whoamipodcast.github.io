<p><b>Steven:</b> Why we think that having a chat together
is worth doing, actually recording
and sharing?
And that's again because we both like
to broaden our perspectives on different
subjects, and this is a good platform for
doing that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, I noticed that, well
when I had the idea for the podcast I
thought who could I do this
with, and you're the first and only name
that came to my mind. I have had good
chats with other people, obviously, but
not as consistently. And since we've made
an effort to keep in touch since we left
Scotland five or four years ago, we have managed
to keep in touch every few
months at least.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well that's pretty
impressive when you think about it
actually.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The meat of our chats has not
become less. I feel
pretty well understood when I share my
thoughts with you.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Likewise.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's valuable I don't want to leave that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Again there's no pressure, no
criticism, no judgment when we just
chat. Because 
often when people have
discussions it suddenly becomes "right
and wrong" or "my views are more
important"-type discussion.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I especially don't
like the phrase "I disagree", because that
immediately separates us. When I
say that "oh I don't agree" it's like
your opinion doesn't matter.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That is
spot on actually. That is 
what was going for my mind over the last
few days about what I wanted to talk about, the fact that people seem to
think they can't absorb someone's
opinion on something. They feel very
strongly that they have to reject it
because it conflicts with their own. And
that's not how things in
my opinion work. Because
the more opinions you absorb, again, the
more you'll be able to able to understand others.
You don't have to believe them. You don't have to
agree with them. But you can absorb them
and adopt them into your own psyche or
soul or whatever you want to call it,
so that you understand it their point of
view in a way that is, again, loving and
not just a dismissal.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think most
people are capable of that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Definitely.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I'm sometimes offended when I hear other
people's opinions, and I might need to
retreat. But when I feel I'm in a safe
place where I can no longer be
attacked or put in an
uncomfortable conflict situation, then I
can process it and not feel threatened
that moment. Then I can be more
rational about it, which is not always
possible in the moment. And that
I'm confronted with something, you know,
especially when it's a heated discussion
which I don't like in general.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Again
there's no need for a heated discussion.
It just seems to be something
that happens, that suddenly someone
gets defensive about a topic.
And we forget that you can just pause
and go "okay let's stop, it's becoming heated.
Let's come back to this. We don't want it
to be heated." It's just unnatural, maybe
it's our natural defense mechanism
kicking in. And that people don't
necessarily have that
wall in their brains, haven't learned to... Again it takes
practice. You know I
often got into many a heated
discussion in the past because life is
an ongoing process, and not being able to
go "hang on a minute, take a step back"
because I think that's very
important in discussions. Just pause, like
"okay".
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah that's what real discussions
should be like. It's sad to see in the
media, say with political discussions.
The channels, the platform's just
love controversy and fighting.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And it's
all so quick, it's all so fast. You've got to 
answer things in two seconds. As I was
watching the Joe Rogan show / podcast 
they had Bernie Sanders on.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I saw that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So you saw that as well. It was an amazing discussion.
And he was discussing, he was
talking about, how you have these
debates that are just 
too fast.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah they call it a soundbite.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You
don't get time to actually discuss in
a nice way your policies.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The nuances. There's no room for nuances.
And Bernie only had one hour time for
Joe Rogan, only. Joe can talk to people
for three hours like Jordan
Peterson. He loves talking to him. I think
he's had him on twice. 
That's the the number one podcast,
I heard.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Is it? Good.
Again, he brings in lots of different
perspectives. He doesn't judge, he
doesn't condone in that sense. He
just
hangs out with people.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> He has an
opinion on things: the things
he's passionate about. But he can just be
diplomatic and really interested in a
loving way, like you said. He's respectful,
he gets people on all kinds of
parts of the spectrum and... what were you
going to say?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah he can listen.
He just sits there and every so
often he just throws in his little two
cents' worth.	
He's there to see what
his guests have to say. And the
listeners, he knows the listeners are
there for that as well.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Someone is not,
people are not interested in your
opinion until they feel like you're
interested in theirs and they feel
understood and listened to. It's
something I read. I can't really say that
from experience a lot. I just try, I try
to be aware of other people's opinions
and just yeah, it's not easy to give them
your attention and understanding. It
certainly makes for better relationships.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. Listening is a difficult skill.
I am rubbish at it. I am really bad.
I woffle.
I am quite happy to, again, discuss this as a topic
topic. I'll ask a
question or something, and that person
will have like 30 seconds, and then I'll be like
"oh they said something really
interesting" and I'll start going off on
one again. And I just like need to learn just
to be quiet.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Is it an attention thing or do you just
love the sound of your own voice?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Probably. I'm just excited to just share
what's going on. Somebody else
will say something and I'll just be like
"oh!". Something will trigger in my brain that I
think is interesting
and therefore want to share because I'm
worried if I don't say it now it'll be
gone.
And then I will remember it or something
like that. That's probably what's going
on. Again, it's subconscious in a way.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There are signals like when you take
a breath because you want to say
something. They will see that, at least
most people will be aware of tha. But if
they still talk then I think "I guess they
believe what they have to say is more
important". I think the best
conversations are when you're
willing to sacrifice what you want to
say, and then just adapt to what the
other person says. It's not
always easy.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's not. It's about asking
questions as well, isn't it. It's being
able to
know what questions to ask people when
just having discussions. But things
like, you know, "what's your opinion?", "how do
you feel about this?". Those kind of things.
I also think a lot of my woffleness, if
that's even a word, comes from spending
a lot of time with quiet people.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You're a waffle maker.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I'm a
waffle maker, it's true. I like it. My
brain is a waffle maker.
