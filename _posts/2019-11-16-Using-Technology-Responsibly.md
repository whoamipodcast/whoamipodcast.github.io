<p><b>William:</b> 
It seems like for some people
progress is just finding something new.
But unfortunately it's often the case
that whenever you find something
in technology that makes life easier or
better like health-wise or comfort or
shelter, food, clothing, communication,
whatever, it also comes with a downside.
I don't know if that's part of the
technology or a part of humanity, that we
just use anything there is for good and
bad, depending on who we are or how
pressed we feel, how desperate we feel. I
think anyone has the potential of doing
bad.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, the intention
behind the progress. But isn't just what
you said about making things easier,
that tends to be the goal, is to somehow
make our lives as humans easier. And
I don't always think that's a good thing.
It depends how you define easier.
But in terms of science progress,
that's more trying to answer questions,
like science progress itself, is the
robotic side. I guess the intention
is more "let's do this
because we can", I think, rather than "it is
gonna actually advance us in any
conscious or physical way". It's just "hey
we're here now, let's keep going".</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Right. We have values and goals, like
everyone for themselves, but also
collectively. And when new technology
comes along we usually try to, well, some
people try to see the new opportunities:
what is now available, how will this
change our outlook on life, on our
purpose on our identity? But others will
just try to use the new technology for
the same old goals. So, I don't know if
I've told you, I follow John McAfee on
Twitter. He became
famous through his antivirus software
maybe, I don't know, 20, 30 years ago.
He's a big name in anti virus. And now he
is a huge proponent of cryptocurrency.
So when you think of cryptocurrency,
the first things that pop in your
head is probably Bitcoin, digital
currency, and the currency market.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yes.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
There are tons of currencies, hundreds,
maybe thousands. I don't know. And people
trade them a lot to get profit, which is
interesting. It's fun.
There is no taxing involved because it's
decentralized. The government has no
access to it, at least, well even though
the blockchain is public, the
government cannot see who's doing what
because it's all anonymized.
And something that McAfee said about
that was "People! This is not a toy. You
can do so many great things with
blockchain. Stop treating it like a
toy and just making more money. That's
the old way of thinking about life and
how the world works. We could be so much
more independent. We could be so much
more free. He's an anarchist, by the way.
He wants people to see their potential.
And so
you just reminded me of this when you
said "are we using new technology to
progress and our understanding of who we
are and what the purpose of life is, or
are we just using it for the same old
things?"</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, it's I guess in our
current culture and society. We're very much
money-based. Everything is
money money money. And it's "you can't get
away from that unless you've made lots
of money". Like you I guess work to live
and live to work. That's the constant
cycle. And it's painful. There's very few ways to get out of that.
Until you do, do you get to be able
to explore other systems like ...?
Because cryptocurrencies, I think,
requires a certain amount of
understanding of technology. And also
the regulation of these things 
you say the anarchy side of it, and
it having free reign, which I believe in.
But at the same time, my brain contradicts
that, or the culture or the psychology of
our culture contradicts that: Well who's
to say one person just comes along, is
a genius at it, makes billions, and then
writes everyone else off.
How do you regulate to stop things
like that from happening?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I know. I can't say I'm an
anarchist. I see some very attractive
aspects of the ideology. I'm
not sure how to how do you think about
it yet. I see that no matter who is in
power, let's say in the industry or in
government or the banks, whatever, no
matter who is in power, they will
abuse the power somehow, because nobody's
perfect. And they're at the top level.
If there's no one
over them to make sure that they're
going by the rules. So at the UN level
for example it's just countries agreeing
on stuff. They call the, resolutions, right?
And then there's no way to, what's the
word, legislate. There will be no
repercussions if you don't keep to your
promise.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, there's no one regulating
the regulator's</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Right. And so anarchists don't
believe in no order. That's not the way
they mean it. They believe that everyone
is responsible for being orderly, for
being peaceful. They have this
non-aggression principle: that all
interactions, and all trade in particular,
should be to the benefit of both parties.
There should never be exploitation.
But I don't see how that could be
enforced either. That's so idealistic.
But I do like the point that
everyone is responsible for discipline
in themselves, for being in charge of
themselves, and making sure that your
values are harmonic in themselves and
work as well as possible with those of
others without forcing
them onto someone else. Yeah, responsibility is the right word.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
And
that's hard, because how do you implement
that? Because do you force people, one
generation, to get that mentality into
their system and then let it fly?
Because how do you change
the current status quo?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I don't know. I
just know, I want influence on other
people. So this could be
like a microcosm of what we're talking
about. Like we start to change the world
by changing ourselves, and being a
good influence on the people around us,
like immediately around us.</p>
