<p><b>Steven:</b> It's a good good question, a good discussion point and very
complex as well, as you just kind of just
showed: the fact there's so many
different multiple ways you can respond
to these things.
But I think, so in religion, what you
talked about is a great parallel with
that, and psychology and mental health at
the moment. So again, this is my own personal
views. But you talked about
being honest about an emotional
situation that's difficult, or just even
talked about a little bit about it. You don't need
to open up completely, because it leads
to isolation if you don't. Because you
feel that everyone else is doing fine
and doing well, because that's what you
see, you go "Oh, well I'm doing bad. So I
don't feel I don't feel happy. Or I don't
feel complete. Or I don't feel good
about something, but everyone else is. So
it must be different and weird and alone
or whatever." So into psychology there's
often a teaching about how you can't
say the words "Oh, I understand."
You know, if someone talks about their
situation you can't go
"Oh, I understand", because you can't understand that,
because you're not in their specific
circumstances. And I do completely
understand and get that. But we
experience the
same emotional responses. So you know, as
human beings we all have, you know,
happiness, sadness, pain, love, joy, bliss,
disappointment, jealousy. All these
different things that we have, they are
what connect us. So in a psychological
point of view, actually, when you're
discussing something, if someone
actually shows they
do understand the emotions you're going
through it creates a bond, it creates a
connection I think as human beings we're
lacking in this day and age. It's a lack of
community, a lack of connection
through things like Facebook and
social media projecting false
identities of just happiness and other
positive things. And that happened
at the church scenario of
Christian religion, where you project the
positive happiness. Because that's, you
know... happiness is great. It's good. But
actually, if that's but a lie, if you're
also struggling, you need to be able to
talk about that. You need to be able to
talk about those things and actually cry
about something that you're struggling with,
or talk about it. But you don't feel you
can because the way the community
currently has almost shot itself in the
foot, to use that phrase. You know it's
because they're too busy trying to be
righteous and good, they forgot how to be
human, and how to be honest and open
about their emotions, to create those
connections.
There's nothing like my
spiritual experiences. I believe
the term "spiritual" and "emotional"
I think are very closely linked, personally.
And I think when you have an emotional
experience with someone, whether you bond
through hard times or good times,
it creates a spiritual bond. And I think
that's probably what church actually is
designed for. We talk about going
through a meeting in a church, and we
talk about community, as I think the
foundation should be built on emotional
connections. Not everyone can. It's
difficult for people. But again, over time
you can facilitate that. So I can
understand totally why you struggle,
well I struggle with it as well, and why
it's difficult.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. That's true. Some people believe
that can just sit in their garden
and meditate, and get the same spiritual
experience and connection to God
as in church. But that community aspect
is huge. Because, even if you are
experiencing only positive emotions,
there's plenty of opportunity to serve
others who are not. So sometimes you're
more a taker, and sometimes you're more
giver.
And both are needed.
Alright, so we talked about social and
emotional and psychological aspects of
church and church community. But is
a church just club, just a society that
people go to to share experiences, to be
there for one another? Or is there
actually another layer to it that makes
a bond between a person and God? You
earlier mentioned something about
singing taking it to the next level. And
I believe you were talking about
Christian principles motivating you to
be there for others rather than just
common sense and empathy. So what what is
this extra level, if there is one,
that makes religion and faith so
important to us and other people, that
goes beyond just being a club or unity, a
union of people?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I guess the obvious answer
is: try to know your place in the
universe. That's why people do it, I think.
Whether you believe it's
true or not, or whether you believe
something like... because we could go into a
massive debate about all that. No matter
what the discussion point in that
respect is, I think people, to answer the
question, a lot of people need to
have something to ground them in this
massive universe that we live in. And having a deity, a creator, a perfect
figure... and sometimes not a perfect figure.
Obviously in Norse mythology,
Greek mythology all their gods
definitely weren't perfect. They were
definitely fallible. It's only really a
Christian concept, Judeo-Christian
concept, of a perfect being, being God.
The whole reason we did the
podcast is "Who am I?" And I think that is
why people
gravitate towards religion, I think, and
create it. And that's what makes it more
than just a club. Because a higher
function I think about...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay, so if I think
of the Maslov hierarchy, often shown
as a triangle or a pyramid, you are
talking about the human need that goes
beyond immediate needs like shelter, food,
clothing and what comes after that:
friendship, community. I don't remember
all the details right now. But you're
getting to the to the top
layer that is called "transcendence" or
"self-actualization", stuff like that. So
when you start asking big questions. You
call it your place in the universe. Or I
would say "What is my purpose in life?",
"What is the purpose of humanity as a
whole?", "What use is it to do good in
general?" What is all this
good for? Because the minute you start
getting a bigger picture because you've
taken care of the lower-level
necessities of life, you start with more
questions. Because life is infinitely
complex, and there will always be more
challenges, more questions. And I love
that about life. It makes it a great
adventure. But it also means that there's
always more ways you can suffer, to put
it bluntly. Because, well, that motivates
you to change and to seek new approaches,
new answers. So is religion always the
way for people to approach these
questions? I think it's not the only one.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> No.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Meditation, study of any kind of books,
history books. It doesn't have
to be religious books. Just just seeking
more insights, I think, is a natural
tendency for people who ask these
questions. Some people just go under
with these questions and will become
depressed and maybe start drinking, or
you know go in another way if they feel
overwhelmed by the challenge, or
become suicidal because they believe
there is no answer to questions like
"What is the purpose of life?", and they
will start to believe that that there is
no purpose and that life is just a big
illusion, stuff like that. So it's tricky
to go that way.
And I think that's why there is a
certain order to the steps that you take
in the Maslov hierarchy. You
shouldn't do too many challenges at the
same time.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Purpose, as you say, purpose. No matter
whether it's religion or just in life in
general, we all feel we need to have a
purpose. I mean kind of side tangent here:
things like male depression
and male suicide is at an all-time high
in society. It's because a lot of men
don't feel they have a role or a purpose in society.
That's completely a different side topic by itself.
But even at a basic level of needing to
be in a football club with people
or having a job or having a family, you
have a purpose. You fit
into a situation. So like you talked
about with religion: religion creates a
situation where you have a role or a
purpose. You are God's child, one of God's children on
this earth who will give you, he will give
you, they will give you exaltation,
everlasting life, heaven, that bliss,
whatever. You're given a
purpose through that scenario in
Christian-Judeo religion, obviously
with coming from a very much Western...
Because there's so many other religions
we'll talk about, I'm sure, in the podcast at some point.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That goes
into the question "Is there life after
death?" Right?
"Or does life just abruptly end, and
then it was like you never existed all
of a sudden?" So yeah, I can understand how
that is a huge question that a lot of people
confront some time in their life.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And it can be both, like you said,
trapping and freeing. So you talked about
being trapped: if people don't
really have a purpose or that there's no
life after death, then what's the point?
Then they go suicidal or whatever.
Actually it's very freeing as well. It's
very much... if you actually go to that
point where you're like "Ok, I don't
have to worry about my choices. I'm a
good person. I'm not goint to kill someone or
something, whatever. But I don't have to
worry about the guilt and the
overanalyzing of my behavior, that God
might judge me or people might judge me",
then you become actually, in my opinion, a
very much happier person. I have
become a much happier person since not being
around the environment. And for me
personally that's very freeing. And I
still, you know, I believe in a life
after death. But even if there
wasn't I'm like "Hey, this is cool. I'm
doing very well for who I am
as a person. I'm not going to save the
world, and I'm not trying to kill anyone.
But I'm within my little bubble, sphere."
It's like "I am doing exceptionally well
as an individual." And I think having a, I
guess, the life out of death scenario,
whether you have it or not is very much
up to the individual, how they respond to
it, I guess. Because some people, you know,
will freak out with that and need the
purpose, which religion really helps
provide, no matter what it is. And
sometimes people aren't religious and still
believe in life after death; well they
believe that
there is something after. Most people do,
I think. Most people think that, hope
there is something else after life.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I've
noticed that, too.
I've talked to several people who do not
have a formal faith, do not associate
with a certain religious community, but
they certainly wish, they certainly have
the desire, to stay united with their
loved ones. So that's a very common
thing. And so that will motivate some
people to investigate a religion.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The LDS
church itself provides that. They
provide a lot of discussion, a lot of
teachings about, you know, what came
before we are on this earth, earth life,
and then post-earth life, obviously death.
And there's a lot of really
interesting facts. Some of the things that I've
been most drawn to, I think, in a theological
aspect, of what they teach. Again, people
can look at it for themselves.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I just noticed with
your last comment that this answer about
life after death does not only get into
the purpose of life, but also your old
value system. So you mentioned "Am I a good
person?" And then apparently, I haven't
thought this through, that's why I'm just
noticing it now, apparently the answer to
"What is my purpose in life, or of life in
general for humanity?" will also give you
an orientation of "What should I be
spending my time on, my energy?", "How should
I treat myself and other people?", and "Am i
doing well in life?" Because a
goal sets a path that leads you to that
goal. So it's not just a thing about
what happens at death or thereafter.
But what leads up to that point? And what
should I be doing before? We like to
say in the church "Now is the the time of
our probation, when we prepare for what
comes after."
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The choices now we make is very
much a key factor, I guess, isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. We believe that small things that we
decide and do now can have eternal
consequences.
That sounds very drastic, and it can
feel overwhelming to people who haven't
fully understood the plan that God has for
us.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, the principles themselves often
in all life, again, in my
opinion, is... It's up to us
whether we put a positive or negative on
them. So in that situation of
what we do now affects our eternal
existence. Well that can be
terrifying, or that can be very hopeful.
It's literally a choice that we
have to make. You could be like "Ok, great. I'm doing I'm doing
good now." So, you know, "I'm a good person.
I'm doing well." Often we seem to always
jump to the negative, whether this is
a cultural thing or a
human thing, where we just go "Oh, I'm not
as good I should be." or "I'm terrible." or
"I stole a sweet last week." or whatever
"And now I'm going to hell". And it's like,
okay well that's a bit of a dramatic
negative that we seem to just default to
often. And actually if we think
about things in a boarder sense,
if we looked at them objectively, we'd
realize how well we're doing and
wouldn't have to fear, wouldn't have to
worry. But I think we spend so long
in the church, in life in general,
focusing on what we SHOULD be doing and
not actually how well we are doing.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That has a massive impact on the psychology.
And I think a lot of the negatives that
the world sees about religion and
spirituality are much a reflection
of humanity's ability to jump to a
negative before looking at a positive, I
think. Because in the community, in a
church, in whatever, we all do it.
We all seem to just jump to the negatives
first. At least that's my observation
And when actually things are
negative they just are. And it's up
to us as individuals to... which takes
time. It takes decades, it takes
years. It takes a long time to make those
realizations and concrete them in our
behavior.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, usually long after we've
already raised children and handed off
the those false beliefs to the next
generation.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. Again, it comes back to "Who am I?" All these
things we're talking about, they help us
to explore who we are as an individual,
as well as a culture and community.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
just thought of something philosophical
having to do with what you said. I do
want my decisions to matter.
I do want there to be consequences.
Otherwise I would probably lose all
motivation to make any decisions. At the
same time I don't want there to be too
strong of a consequence. I don't want
the judgment about my decisions and
behavior to be too stark. I want to be
judged more by my intentions than my
actions. Because somehow this life is
created in such a way that there is a
huge gap. And some days I wish my
actions were one-to-one aligned with my
intentions. But then again, there would be
no room for mistakes or progress. So you
can see how there's this huge setup
necessary to make freedom of choice
possible but also not fatal. And I
believe that
the earliest church has an amazing take
on this problem. It's not complete. It
doesn't answer all the all the great
philosophical questions that people have
had through the centuries. But for me
personally, it helps me with questions
like free will and "What should be the
norms and the maxims of a society?" and
"Is there a need for an authority, like, in
this case, a God?" So I don't know how
deeply I should get into that. But we
could talk a whole episode about stuff
like that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> When I
talk to people about religion and
stuff and talk about my background, I
often tell them "If you ever
want to explore yourself through a
microscope, you know, go to the LDS Church.
If you ever want to go and learn
something that will give you a new
insight, something new, something deeper
than what we generally
experience through life, then go spend two months, six months, a
year, living that lifestyle and learning
what is taught there. Because I'm such a
deeper, more connected, more loving human
being because of what I've learned from
the LDS church. All the
experiences,
they were come across as positive or
negative, as a whole my personality, who
Steven is, is a thousand times better
just for being through that experience.
And again, whether you believe
every single principle it teaches, or
the hierarchy, or some
of the traditions, whatever, all that
aside, it is just so much better in
my opinion for a person to go through an
experience like that with what
the LDS Church teaches
about our place in the
universe.
It's quite incredible.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> We have some
amazing philosophical discussions.
And the approach can be quite
different than what we're used
to from science and, you know, scientific
philosophy. But as you were talking my
mind just skipped to a negative
interpretation what you said, just
like you said earlier. And I just want to
cover it a little bit in case anyone
else had the same thought. So maybe you
can clarify. It just sounded to me
like a scary thing that our church could
be one of those crazy religions you
sometimes hear about, I don't want to
name any names, that psychoanalyze you
all the way through and through.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, yeah.
I meant as an individual. So if you want
to. No matter what you do in
life, it's your choice in many situations.
So when you go to the
LDS church, THEY won't do it. It's you
yourself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Exactly.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Sorry.
I should clarified that. It's not like
they're gonna...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, it's fine. It's fine. I agree
with everything you said.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> From an individual point of view, if you want to learn more about yourself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. It's entirely voluntary. And you set
your own pace, how much I want to delve
into your your psyche, your fears, your
past. I don't really feel a
pressure to go into that. Actually, I feel
our lessons are often too superficial and not personal enough.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I meant as a natural
process, just by being in the community. I
wasn't explicit enough. It's like you sit down, you go
"Okay, today I should psychoanalyze myself
in this way." I just mean in general.
So I didn't clarify that. So I apologize.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There is
no brainwashing, there is no breaking you
down and destroying you so that you can
be built up properly from the beginning.
There are sometimes opportunities, and
again, voluntary, to speak to a leader,
we call them bishop,
the leader of the congregation, and to
reflect. So he he might ask personal
questions about how you're doing in life.
And it's just an opportunity for you, if
you want more support from the church,
to open up about it. I like this, that
you don't have to be totally proactive,
that, you know, some people need a nudge
and encouragement to even ask for help.
It can be very difficult for some people, including me.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I've had some amazing
leaders and some absolute, this sounds
terrible, but some absolutely horrifically bad,
unempathetic leaders.
It's a fascinating. And we're all just human beings, just going through this
process of learning. And more of the
insightful things I've been able to
achieve or discuss or whatever has just
been with general members or people in
the community. And, as you say,
it's nice to have that choice of a
backup of going to speak to someone
who's in a position of
authority, a position of leadership. But
the interesting thing is that, yeah actually, I've gained
more insight from you about who God
is and our discussions about that kind
of thing and what we believe
than I ever did from any of the leaders.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. It shows you that you need to
be proactive and get some some insights
from your own studies, your own
discussions, your own friends.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's friends, isn't it. It's friends and family.
It's just being able to have a community
that's like a family. And you pick and
choose. You know, you can't be friends
with everyone. You can be friendly with
everyone. But you have to create a small
network of people who are like-minded, if that's what you want.
It's up to what you want. You can go
church, and that's it. You know, you'll learn and experience things that
way. Or you can go and throw yourself
into getting to know a few people and
making those connections we talked about
earlier.
And they will help
the whole "Who am I?" situation quite a lot.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I feel more
fulfilled for having a spiritual aspect
in my life. I could have a good life
with my passions for science, for
traveling, for the exchange with other
people on levels like emotional,
psychological, intellectual. But I need
more, personally. I need to feel a purpose
in life, a direction. And I need it to not
be told to me. I need it to find it for
myself. I have found it partially. But the
search and the desire for direction goes
on. I'm kind of happy that it's not all
there yet. I don't know what life would
be like; maybe boring, maybe
fulfilling. I don't know. I'll see when I
get there.
But this religion is really good
that way. And to answer an earlier
question I gave you about it being more
than just a club and an exchange among
friends,
I do feel a connection to God, and that
it gives me a purpose and a fulfillment
that nothing else has or can, as far
as I know. So that is something unique,
something special, and something that has
broadened my perspective, and just my
identity, my whole life.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think that's a
good thing to finish on. I think that's
really the key to religion's
actual supposed purpose. It's my personal opinion of what religion should be, is
to give you that help to know who
you are in your connection to God
and your place in the universe, I guess.
</p>
