title: What Makes Parenting Worth the Sacrifice?
epnumber: 5
section: 2
description: As a young person enters the new adventure of becoming a parent, they are confronted with challenges they can never be truly prepared for, no matter how much knowledge they acquired beforehand. Making mistakes and learning from them in practise seems to be the only way for us to progress, be it as children or as parents.

<p><b>William:</b> Neither of us
is a parent
yet. But I'm sure you've thought about
this before: What will you do once there
is a little person in your life and
you're responsible for their development
and feeding and shelter and clothing and
and all of that, obviously? But let's
stay focused on the ethical,
emotional, mental factors. What
difficulties do you expect there will be
once you have that huge responsibility
for a child for your first time?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's a good question. Because
obviously this podcast is "Who am I?" But
how do you deal with when you have
somebody that's learning the whole
process themselves? So that they're going
for the process of "Who are they?", and
you're still also going through the
process of "Who am I?" So you're trying to
be a good parent and do the right thing;
but are you doing the right thing for
you, or are you doing the right thing for
the child? Not even the
right thing, just the thing that you
think is right. Because there's a difference, obviously. Potentially there's
supposed to be you know
maybe five different right things.
Because again it's not always just one.
And then multiple like actually bad
things. And then (shrug) does it matter as
long as you get a sort of right answer?
You know, who knows? But when I
have a child, who knows? I thought
about it a lot. But in the moment
you can't predict really how you're
going to respond. You can just try and
prepare yourself as much as possible to
be ready for those insane... I think a lot of that,
having been around the nitty-gritty of
parenting, I think parenting
isn't that difficult. But when you see
the blood, sweat and tears that happens
you start to lose a lot of little
judgments around parenting. But,
to get on topic, to stay on focus, I think
there are certain things which are
right or wrong.
For example discipline, discipline is a
primary part of parenting.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Disciplining? Is that what
you're getting at, like to enforce?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, so,
to help an individual child understand
what is right and wrong.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> When I
was a child I thought my parents could
do no wrong. I rarely ever saw them make
mistakes. Obviously the older I got the
more obvious it became that they are
fallible too. But you know in the
beginning just whatever the parent does
is the right thing. And I suppose a naive
parent will think that whatever is right
for them is right for everyone. And
therefore there is no difference between
what is right for the child and what is right
for the parent. But the older I get the
more I realize how clueless and naive
people are, even at the age of being
parents. I mean that's apparent.
But now that I am at that age I
wonder how bad of a job I would do if I
suddenly were a parent. And it can come, it
can happen suddenly. We often have
those nine months
to prepare. Even that isn't a long
time, considering all the things that you
could learn to, in theory, become a
perfect parent. But even then I think you
need to just practice.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Experience, yeah. You made an
interesting statement about how bad a
bad a parent I'm going to be. And I think
it's an interesting perspective. I
think it's actually the correct one for
everyone. Because I think we all try and
think you know we'll be the best parents,
good parents; but no matter what we do
it's never gonna feel good
enough as a parent. You love your
child,
well, again, if you're an ideal parent; you
will love a child and you'll try and do
the best for them. But to the child it
will probably, for most of their
childhood and teenage years, it'll never
be enough what you do. And to yourself
you'll feel that way. So it's limiting
the amount of, I guess, bad the damage
that's done. I know that sounds really
extremely negative. But I think that's
kind of
just how parenting is. I think you're
never going to get it right. That's my own
personal opinion. No matter what you
choose, there's gonna be something ideally right. Again, "right" is
such a wrong word to use; "optimum"
maybe.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think I get your point. Obviously
you can prepare and avoid huge
mistakes. You need to work on
yourself before you can attempt being a
parent. You can, for example... I
think, maybe an easy one is nutrition.
What do you feed a baby? You know, in the beginning when
they have no teeth you need to be very
careful what you feed them. Malnutrition
is a crime for babies. They just
get to be fat. You should just think of
it as cute rather than wrong. And then it
gets a lot subtler of course. But
you're right: no matter how well we
prepare, we're going to make some
mistakes. I know of of a psychologist who
is in the media sometimes: Gabor Maté, I
think his name is. And the son is also
in the media as a reporter: Aaron Maté.
And so Aaron has even interviewed his
father on his news show. But the father
admitted that "Yeah, I know. I'm fully
aware that my weaknesses were
transferred onto my son. And I'm not
excusing myself. It's just, it is
difficult to see sometimes." For him it
must become apparent that what
he just did must be painful for him:
"It comes from the mistakes I made when
he was small." But somehow they just live
with it and try to improve themselves
along the way. We all take some
form of trauma or pain from our
childhood with us that we were not able
to process or, you know, accept at the
time, and then work on it later on in
life. So I guess rather than trying
to prevent every mistake it's good
to become aware of them, become
aware of the weaknesses that we pass on
as parents and that we receive from
parents, and be forgiving and loving, and
just deal with our own weaknesses rather
than trying too hard to correct other
people.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Aaron Mate.jpg"></div>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. You mentioned obviously
loving. And parenting is very much a, I
guess, selfless act because it's about time
and energy that it takes to be a parent.
Most parents lose their social
life, a lot of their social life. And
that you have to have a mental barrier because you can end up resenting your
child. So you know, if you without
realizing having to you know feed, clothe,
stay up late till 3:00 in the morning
looking after your ill sick child. All
these different things have a
psychological effect on both parents, well
the parent first of all. And then if the
parent isn't loving enough,
doesn't tap into that biological and
psychological necessity, then you
end up resenting your child. Because
you feel that they're being selfish even
though it's just the nature of their
development. They need someone. So
it can be a struggle to
make sure you don't as a parent let that
take over. I don't know if so many parents are
like that. You just see in their
eyes 
they would on the surface be doing what
needed to be done. But the little huffs
and the eye rolls and the eyebrows raises
and all these little facial expressions
that show deep down that
they're exhausted of being a parent. And
I think that's because a lot of people
become parents, again controversial, when
they're not ready. Do you think that at all?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I don't know if you're ever ready. I
just had to think of John McAfee
who recently said, who wanted to give
advice to young men. He said: "Don't get
married before you're 40 because you
won't know what you're doing." And then
people commented: "What about women? You
can't just give advice to men." And he
said: "Well most of them are just as
applicable to women any way." But I guess he
could just put himself in the shoes of
young men better than young women. I
don't know. But no I don't advocate
people not getting married or starting a
family until they're 40.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, me neither.
It was again its general statement of
they're probably... There
should be more education. You're
never ready for parenting. You're never
ready for that kind of commitment, that kind
of process. There should be so much more
help and
preparation before you do that, I guess.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think most of
the education
you get about that is not formal, but
comes from your parents and maybe
friends who have been through the
process already, well who have started the
process already. But there are ways,
there are sources for formal training. I
know some universities even have courses
and entire subjects for I don't know
what they call them, but family, household
stuff.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Family planning is
usually what we call it over here. But I don't
know what the translation would be.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah,
and these days you can find all kinds of
stuff on the internet. You just obviously
need to be careful not to
believe junk. Use common sense. But I
think people in general just feel the
need to help children. Because children
are so vulnerable and dependent. So if
someone, if I walked on the street
and saw someone abusing their child, even
though it's none of my business, in a
sense, I would feel a strong force to to
intervene.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The most interesting is: so would
they in their roles reversed. So because
they are a parent... Because they're a parenting
you know all the time, they're
constantly drained by the situation
because they don't have enough barriers
put up, over time they haven't
learned the process of not letting tiredness and exhaustion overcome love.
Because we could be out on the street, like you
say, and see someone. If they're in pain
people generally are lovely because they're
like "Oh, an innocent child, we must
protect them." But if you... Let's say
you take 100 people the age of 20, you give
them a child at the age of three for a
month. I think in that month those 20-year-olds would just be going nuts. They would
be sleep-deprived. They would be
depressed, they would be... most of
them, again not all. But most of them would be. And
they would be at borderline, probably like
discipling too harshly to the children
to keep them quiet, using all the easy
methods like giving them the computer all day,
TV all day,
just keep them quiet. Again in small
doses I believe it's fine. But it's a
fascinating, I guess, contrast between
what we can handle from the outside to
what we can when we're the actual parent.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, interesting.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That would be a cool
education. I think everyone
should. I think
society should give people the ages of
between ages 15, 16 and roughly 20 every year
have a week, 48 hours, just with a 
young child. Because it would give them,
like you said, an experience of how it works.
But also it would make them think twice before
just going ahead and having children
straight away.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> In two cartoons, I think, I've seen
something like this. And that gives
me the thought that maybe in American
high schools there is an experiment at
least like that, where a boy and a girl,
like everyone will get paired up so that
you're like parents, and a boy and a girl
will each get an egg, maybe with a face
drawn on it or something; and the task is
to keep it safe for one week. Can
you at least make sure that the egg
doesn't crack or something similar like
that?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's so demoralizing. It's
horrific. Because it again... I get the sentiment
at the psychology behind it all, but it's
like, if you fail that experiment you are
then made to look like a horrific
person.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It gives you something to think about.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, true. And then also it's nothing
like actually being a parent. You're not
getting the reward. Because the good
thing about parenting is actually
the positive side of it. That's all about the
negative side. But at the positive side
where you literally have this incredible
intellectual being that can be
happy, fun and teach you so much. Oh my
goodness, my nieces and nephews have
taught me so much of just how to
be a better person.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's true. None of that would be
in the experiment. I love to
play with my nieces and nephew as well. I
often don't think of it as learning.
But you're right. There's plenty we can
learn from people younger and less
experienced than us. Because, well, one
reason is that
they have less care, less of a
burden in this world. And so you can
be reminded of all the things that you
miss out on because you worry so much
about things that are not so important
but just necessary, apparently, maybe. So
you get reminded of the basics and
what makes you happy. Because that's what...
Children just want to be happy all the
time, no matter the consequence.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's a perfect statement right there. "Let me teach you how to be happy." Yeah, you turned out perfectly.</p>
