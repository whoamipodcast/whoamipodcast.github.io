title: Consequences of type 1 and type 2 errors in RNA testing
epnumber: 12
section: 0
description: The PCR method has been abused to test for Covid-19 by exaggerating the method's number of amplification cycles. The degree to which human genetic material is thus magnified leads to the test being overly sensitive and sky-rocketing its false postive rate. Should this cause concern for the centralisation of political power over our economies that has been justified by saving the lives of citizens, or are the lockdowns worth the risk?
