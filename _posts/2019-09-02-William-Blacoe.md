A native German, William grew up in a bilingual family. He loves to travel worldwide, usually with no more than a backpack. His favourite books and films are from the Sci-Fi genre. Playing board games with friends and listening to soundtrack music are common pastimes for him.

When William is not learning a language, he enjoys learning all kinds of useful things that help him to navigate life better. He is known to think outside of the box and to always "challenge the process".

His analytical mind has led him to the fields of computer science, linguistics and the intersection of both: language science in IT. Beyond the science, though, he enjoys philosophising about these and other topics, as well as their meaning for him and humanity.
