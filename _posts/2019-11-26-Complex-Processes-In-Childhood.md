<p><b>William:</b> Okay.
Let's get back to the story about
the development of, again, a little boy
first of all. I don't know if this
applies one-to-one to little girls. I have
read that there is a complex
on the flipside. I don't remember the
name of it. Some woman in some
mythical story probably again who fell
in love with her father. I can't remember
the name. But there is a theory that the
same exists for the other side.
I'm just not as familiar with it, and I
don't know if it would really be the
same mirrored, or if there would be other
parts to that situation. But a boy is
attracted to his mother at the age of 2
or 3, and he realizes that she doesn't
feel the same way about him. He feels
like the father gets in the way. Right? So
he's jealous of him.
So he is in a fight with the father.
And this is mainly in his mind, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. Sorry to interrupt again, but 
does the theory say it's sexual or does
it say it's emotional?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think both.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Or is this different
from what you've heard?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I don't know much about
biology, but
it just seems like the term "sexual" seems
very strange to be used as children if you
don't have a sexual... you don't have
an actual sexual impulse.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I see.
Because you haven't been through puberty?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I guess that's a different
level than what adults or, you
know, teenagers go through.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There is a bond there 
obviously between a parent and a
child. But to use the term "sexual" seems
very dark and strange.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right. It's not
like the boy knows about sexual activity
and that's what he wants. It's just
he feels naturally drawn to his mother,
and not just any woman, but just his
mother in the beginning.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> "Maternal" for a better word, it's
maternal attraction.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Sure, yeah. So, she is
the representative of womanhood for him
at that state, and the father of manhood.
He realizes that they're a couple. He
cannot get to his mother because she
seems to always go to his father to be
close. This this doesn't mean
that he observes them having sex. Just
them being happy together,
or maybe kissing. I don't how aware
he is of those things. But there is
definitely a triangle dynamic going on.
And so he is conflicted because he needs
the support of his father. He realizes that
he's dependent on his parents. You know,
his father takes the role of kind
of defending the family from outside
dangers. But at the same time he wants to
be close to the mother and has a problem
with the father being there, being the
partner of the mother. And so he's kind
of in a competition. And obviously he
cannot physically fight the father.
That's not how it works, how it turns out.
But the fight goes on in his mind mainly.
And he is trying to figure out what to
do about the situation. It would be nice
if he could just wish for the father to
be gone. I mean that's probably what he
does anyway, just wishes him to be gone.
But if that doesn't happen then he has
to come up with another strategy. But he
realizes
he can't do anything to get the mother
for himself.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I mean, you would know if
the child would, because you'd know
through screaming or crying.
A child is biologically
programmed to survive. And if there is a
threat, the threat being the other parent,
then... to the attention that it wants,
because survival is also at that
stage the happiness thing. So what makes
me happy? Being with mommy or being with daddy
 or whatever. And then that's
part of his survival programming. Then yes, he
threatens that. Children
are so good at manipulating parents.
It's uncanny what they can do and
say to play the parents off each other, to
throw tantrums that gets the attention of
one parent.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's
a good point.
They don't even know they're doing
it. They just act on instinct, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So what happens next? If
everything turns out well, you know, in a
healthy sexual development, the boy will
realize that he cannot have the mother
for himself, and he will distance himself, I want to say, emotionally, but not in
every sense emotionally, because there's
still a bond there, the one that you
end up having in the end with your
mother, you know, a source of support and
understanding, but not a sexual
connection. So he kind of gives up on
that, and then basically starts looking
elsewhere for a female mate, but,
again, not in the sense as a teenager or
an adult, but just being open to
other women, and no longer being so
focused with that one woman that he
started out with. And a lot of things can
go wrong in this. It's not called a
complex for nothing. And
whatever does happen for that boy can
have consequences for the rest of his
life. I don't know if it's the same
for girls.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It would be very similar.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I imagine they make
connections to their parents as
well.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It'll be... as
children we don't really have an identity
as such. So whether you're boy or girl,
you're still more of a child.
You may be biologically
different, but you don't have the later-on-in-life
impulses or whatever or situation.
So you're just a blank slate. Therefore I
think there will be very similar... We
talk about girls with daddy issues. That's a
phrase that's thrown around obviously a
lot. Or boys with mommy issues.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That
could mean several things. It's not one
phenomenon. But you're right.
The girls' connection to their fathers
can be just as complex. It is just as
important for their sexual development.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, because how your parents treat
each other is very much
another thing from the get-go,
from when you're born. How they treat
each other
is how you're learning to eventually
treat those that you will be partnered with.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Just yesterday as I was walking through
town I saw a guy with his wife,
girlfriend, I don't know. They had a
little girl, probably the daughter,
walking in for them. And he was kind of
in a macho stance. Or the way he held
himself looked a bit macho, you know how
they like to be a bit wide. I
don't know how to describe it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Pumped chest.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's
part of it, and a gold chain around his
neck. And the the girlfriend being more,
you know, subtle or passive, and he
being dominant. And also the way he
spoke to his daughter
sounded macho. And then when I listened
to a bit of what he was saying, I didn't
understand what he said... But I
understood that it was Russian or something
close to Russian. And I thought "wow, this
is exactly like the image I get from the
media about Russian husbands and fathers."
How is it possible that this kind of
behavior can be associated with an
entire country? I guess a big part of
it is that it gets passed on from
generation to generation.
A boy watches his parents, how his
father, in this case, makes demands and how
the mother just goes along with it. And
so he dominates, and she just has to
do what he says. She seems to be
dependent on him. And then we act it out
as though it were a blueprint for the
rest of our lives.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. One big cultural norm, if that counts as a
norm, is shown on media.
It's always just potentially a majority,
potentially, not always. So they got, you know, a lot of
Eastern European and Russian culture
still very much the traditional
masculine male, feminine female,
timid, aggressive... contrasts,
where in Western culture... I'm not
saying... well actually I am saying that one's
better, because actually...
I very rarely do this, put a yeah or nay on it, but
there's no reason for either partner to
be domineering or aggressive towards the
other, you know. That diminishes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
agree. I think it's progress when
someone doesn't hurt the other one just
because they fill a certain role.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, there's no need for emotional suppression in
terms of domineering that
woman or man... can't say what
they feel or think because it's not
appropriate to their role. It's just
nonsense, absolute nonsense.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think none of this
happens out of spite or just
trying to force the situation into being
conducive to the blueprint that we
watched when we were young. I think it's
just an automatic thing.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's a
leftover evolutionary trait that just
we can't seem to shake.
The male being is more
physical, so therefore can go to the
hunting gathering in general.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right, there is definitely a
biological origin for that. I
think it's not arbitrary. But even
in a person's life span will
a person ever
become conscious of his programming and be
in charge of it to consciously make
decisions about what role he wants to
fulfill? I don't know. I guess for some
people that it will happen, but probably
only later on in life, maybe in their 40s
the soonest.
Because it's just so ingrained in
us.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It takes a dramatic situation. As you say, for most
people it'll probably be again in their late 30s, 40s even beyond that they have
a sort
crisis that the they go through a "Who am I?"
process. Because they are now half way beyond their life
expectancy, that tends to be the
trigger, the whole midlife crisis thing.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So they reevaluate.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And it causes a lot of trauma, causes a
lot of difficulties. They don't know what
to do themselves. They go out and do
crazy things, impulsive things. Then they
may just go back to original behavior,
how they were beforehand. Or they may have
progressed and decided to change a few things.
But that change is painful, that
change is difficult. That change requires,
as we talked about before, a certain amount of humility and
modesty to admit you're
wrong. Technically it's not your
fault that you're wrong. That's the thing.
People people don't want
to admit it because they feel like they have to
blame themselves and feel guilty.
That's nonsense. You just go "Okay, that's the way it
was. We found a better way
or a way that looks like it's, I guess,
increased happiness." That's ultimately what
we should be striving for.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. We want
to harmonize with each other. We
want conflicts to disappear, not by
suppressing them, but by understanding
them, and then accepting our situation
and trying to work it out.
