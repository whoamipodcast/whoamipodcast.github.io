<p><b>William:</b> So I like how you
said you do your own part, you study,
and then you pray to have God's guidance
to understand what he needs you to do,
needs you to know, needs you to be. But I
imagine it can be frustrating when your
path isn't very clear. And you said
nobody's perfect. But we are still
supposed to try
to figure out what our path is. What do
you do in times when things are just
fuzzy and you're trying to figure out
what is the next step? Because you don't
want stagnation, right? You want to keep
learning, as you said, keep progressing. Do
you ever have those blockades
where you just need to wait, or you need
someone else to finish some process
before you can progress? Do you have
control over your own path, or does it
ever get difficult like that?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Oh, most
definitely. I can tell you, before I was
where I am now
I had a dry season. And I began to
question God like, "Okay God, am I done?
What's going on? No one's calling me for
anything," you know. And so it's in those
moments when you don't know what to do,
you stand still until God's
will is clear for you, or the path is
clear to you what you need to do. At the
same time, I will say, I preached a
message about a month ago: "hidden but not
abandoned." And a lot of times we think
being hidden is a bad thing and it's not
sometimes God hides you because he's
protecting you, or sometimes you are in
hiding because he's creating a platform
for you to do his bidding on. And so
with that being said, there's also a
scripture that says, "Man plans his own
heart, man makes his own plans.
But God's counsel or his will, that is
what's going to stand." So the thing is, I
want God's will and not my own, because
sometimes my will may be jacked up. And
sometimes it's just like society. You
know, in society, TV, you have some people
that are famous, even some things our
parents instilled in us we
try to strive for those things because
that's what we saw that's what we've
been taught. And everything that we see
or we've been taught may not have been
necessarily the right thing. And so
we have to then at that point ask God,
"Okay God, clear my mindset, because if
this is not for me,
and I'm desiring that thing, then I need
you to take that desire from me so I'm
no longer chasing after something that
I'm wasting my time on."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, when it
gets difficult to know what the next
step is I think that sometimes the best
you can do is just keep doing what has
been right for you in the past, even if
you're not getting that direction, that
spiritual feedback, and just wait for
that dryness to end, like you
called it.
So tell people what
this new book of yours is on.
I saw your latest
book is called "Let it go for your sake"
But is the new one you're
writing in a similar vein?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> It's in a
similar vein to say that it's a self-help
book. But this is not the same
category. The book that I'm working
on right now is entitled "Homosexuality
is in heterosexuals. Relax." And it is a
book to educate the church on how to
love the homosexual and also those who
may want to come out of the...
those homosexuals that may want to come
out of the lifestyle, giving them the
process that they need to come out of
the lifestyle.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, can you give
us some some hints what we can do in
general to be more accepting, more loving
of them?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> One: don't be pre-judgmental. And again, we just
really need to get to take the time to
really meet people. Their sexual
orientation doesn't make them...
And so we really need to build
relationship in order to win trust. And
that will open up the door for dialog to
happen.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, this goes back to what you
said earlier about listening and being
humble. And if you don't have the
experience that someone else has, then
it's easy... you're quick to judge and
just assume that something is wrong with
them or, I don't know, all the different
types of judgment people might have.
I don't have a lot of gay friends.
But the ones I do have, it's not like
that's the only thing I want to talk
about, to learn from them. But when the
topic of homosexuality does come up I
want to learn because I'm curious, and I
want to get rid of those biases that I
just naturally have. So yeah, learning is
key. And, to come back to your last
published book about forgiveness: Now I
see some connection here, right, and
that is putting yourself in someone
else's shoes or at least trying to
accept and allow their perspective. What
are some keys for us how we can
forgive others when they have hurt us,
maybe even inadvertently, and what do we
need to change about ourselves to be
more open in that way?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, the first
question I always propose is this: "If you
were the offender and you did X, Y & Z,
would you want someone to forgive you?"
And most of the time the respons is "Yes."
So we have to practice empathy. If the
shoe was on the other foot and you had
done the offense, would you want
someone to forgive you? And so my
definition for forgiveness is extending
grace to others, extending grace to
others.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that rule about putting
yourself in someone else's shoes is a
big one. That can help you in so many
ways.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Sometimes we don't realize just
how stuck we are in our presumptions. And
so just even through regular contact
with people, it can help you stay aware
of that and that we're all unique, we're
all different. And if people change it's
only because of their own volition, isn't
it.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So if I want to improve myself to
be more open towards others what can I
do?
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Michael Jackson.jpg"></div>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Basically, again, looking inward. We
like to point out what's wrong in other
people instead of looking, as Michael
says, at the man in the mirror. You know the song
says, he said, "I'm looking at the man
in the mirror, I'm asking him to change his ways."
Instead of thinking about what this person did wrong we need to look
inwardly to see, "What could I have done
to me to make the situation better?"
Because
sometimes it's not always one person's
fault. You may have a part in it, too.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay, let me ask you what you think
about this this rule I try to live by:
"A good person is someone who lives by
their values and always strives to
improve their values." So we all have
different value systems. We got them
from our parents, from our society, from
our church if we grew up in a
church. We're not even aware of all
the sources that have influenced us
to give us these values, how we make
decisions, how we treat ourselves and
other people. And we should ever assume
that the process is finished of getting
those values right. So does that go along
with what you're saying?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> I would say to a
certain extent. But we have to be
careful, and it's something you already
have said when you say "values". Because
people could have
high values and people could have low
values. So it depends on the situation. But
what I will say is this, that it is in
every human being,
most people know right from wrong,
even children. Think about children, especially when they're
around age 1 or 2, especially now in this
day: They can do something. They inately know that it's wrong. But
they're looking at you to see what
you're going to, how you're gonna respond,
like, "Are you gonna let me get away with
this?", you know type of thing, knowing that
what they get ready to do is not the
right thing. Or, the other example I like to use is: A
child whose hand is caught in a cookie
jar and the parents come in and say, "You've been in them cookies?"
"No", cookie crumbs all around their mouth.
No one has taught them
how to lie. But because of fear, right, the
fear and different things that they may
be processing on the inside, they
inadvertently lie, not knowing that
they're lying. And I'm talking about the
younger real young children that really
don't, they don't know the concept almost.
And so when you get to a certain age, and
now it's, to me I believe it's more
younger than when we were growing up,
because there's so much knowledge,
there's so much information and
everything's available that those things
that we know at that point, those are the
things that we continue to improve on.
Because a lot of times people can do
what seems to be right from the
outside looking in, like this
person is doing all the right things,
right. But then the inside could be
messed up. Their motives could be wrong.
They're doing the right thing but the
motive is wrong. They've got hidden
agendas and all that kind of different
things. So at that point once you know
right from wrong, then at that point this
is where you, number one, you want to
continue to do the right thing. You can
never go wrong doing the right thing.
Continue on doing that, and then
continuing to elevate... Because a lot of
times people can't accept themselves
because they know what they they're
doing. People on the outside may not know
really who you are. But you know who you
are. I always give this definition: "Reputation is what people see about you.
Your character is who you really are."
So people could be saying all this stuff,
but you yourself really know who you are.
And that's the part that really matters.
Matter of fact they say, "Integrity
is doing the right thing when no one is
looking." When you could have stolen five
hundred dollars, right, and nobody
would've missed it, you hold your
integrity by not touching the money.
That's where it really counts. That's
where it really counts.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. So we need to do our best to be
aware of any inner conflicts that we
might have that way. Because like that
child that got caught, we do the same:
We get caught with mistakes we make.
And we're aware of it at some level. But
I guess the older we get, the better we
get at lying to others and to ourselves.
Can we do something to to counteract
that process and stay as much like a
child as possible?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> I think it's a matter
of really thinking about what you do
before you do it.
Because, you know,
you watch TV, you watch the news, and
sometimes you wonder. I'm saying
this all in humor, but I'm sure it
probably has happened, where they're 50
or 60 years old, and they decide to go
rob a bank.
Well doing that, now pretty much
you're probably gonna be in prison for
the rest of your life off of the other
decision that you made that you really
didn't really think out that thought
process all the way through. Or it could
have just been a thing where you were in
desperation, and we don't know 
how desperation can draw
people to do certain things. But
if it was desperation, at that point then
I would have the question where was your
circle? Where was the people that you
could have probably went to to get some
kind of help on? Or maybe you had the
people but because the pride you didn't
want to go to them. So there's so
many different variables when it comes
to that. But you definitely
want to think before you do anything.
Really think that process out.
There's always a cause and effect to
everything, right? Do this, what is the
effect of that going to be if I get
caught? And then at dinner at the end of
the day here it is again we're talking
about black and white, right? Right and
wrong. Don't take the chance on getting caught,
you know. Because to me, the more
you do the right thing, the easier it is
to do the right thing.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's true.
Wow, thank you.
You have an e-book on your homepage that
talks about apologizing. And I think this
is also closely related to the topic of
forgiveness.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Why can it be difficult
for adults to, or for children as well,
to apologize, and what is that
blockade in our mind that makes it
difficult for us?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> One is entitlement.
I'm entitled to feel how I feel.
I'm stuck with the way I feel. And that's
what makes it hard to apologize, that
entitlement that you wronged me.
And I have a right to not apologize to
you. But a lot of that is pride, too.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah.
So I see a motive here: that you need to
become more aware of your behavior,
what's going on on the inside, what's
causing that behavior, and you need to be
prepared to make changes, because
everyone needs to make changes. That
process of self improvement is never
finished. I'm glad I could ask you
these questions, because I'm always
trying to get other perspectives, deeper
perspectives. You've thought about this a
lot, and I've learned a lot. So thank you
for that.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Thank you.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Are there any
final things you want to
mention about these concepts or
your books?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, the only thing, the
thought that I would leave to your
audience is really for encouragement,
and that is: Your life is what you make
it to be, with guidance. You don't have
sit back and be envious of anyone. You
can have the same things that they have.
But the question is are you willing to
do what they have done to get there?
There's a lot of times we can be moved
and we can be inspired by people. Because
what we see them doing, it seems like
they're doing it effortlessly. It seems
like you know they're
expert at doing it. And all the time just
because you see them doing it so well,
you think you can do it, too. And so this
goes back to our conversation earlier
when I was saying about really embracing
uniqueness and finding your own path,
getting your own life, not
patterning yourself after anything else
or anyone else, but really creating your
own unique journey and really enjoying
that moment. So I said all of that to say,
"Whatever your journey is, whatever your
giftings are, perfect those giftings so
that when the opportunity presents itself,
all you have to do is walk through the
doors." You don't have to be like, "Wait. Can
you give me a week or two?" Because you're
already ready. So what I want to convey
to you all is just to stay in a state
of preparedness. Because this is a
great season for everybody. I believe
this is a good season for every
</p>
