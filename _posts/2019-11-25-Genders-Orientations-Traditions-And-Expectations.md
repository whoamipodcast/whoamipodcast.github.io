<p><b>William:</b> I wanted to get into the Oedipus
phase or the Oedipus complex, it has
different names, which is very
interesting.
I don't know all that much about it. But
it plays a huge role in that development
of gender and your gender role
in society. So here's what I have
learned about it. When you're
born... first of all let's start with birth.
When you're born you are very close to
your mother, obviously. You were part of
her body for a long time. And you want to
remain with her. So most of what I'm saying
is from the perspective of a boy. But
let's see if we can make it more general.
So when you're when your tiny baby, in
the first months of your life, you want
to be close to your mother all the time.
I heard that you can even
feel like you are one person with her.
And so, one of the first things that
happens in your in the development of
your identity is being separated from
her, and I'm not talking about
the physical separation. Obviously that's
a huge thing. I wonder if it's maybe
traumatic for newborns. But the
psychological part as well. So when do we
realize that we are not the same person
as our mothers? Babies don't
necessarily have that consciousness
until they are 2, 3 or maybe even 4.
There are some psychological tests to
detect that. But one of the issues that
comes with this separation is: Well, if
I'm not that person,
meaning the mother, then Who am I? I want
to be like someone to figure out what I
should be like. And so in the case of
being a boy, you very quickly figure out
who is male and who's female. I'm not
sure how many of the features we have go
into that. I suppose voice is a big one.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah It can be two different
things. You've got the social-cultural
and the biological. But you very much Mama, Dada.
That's the two things that are thrown upon you.
It's
almost forced upon you, before you
even get a chance to state your own
understanding of the world. It's like
one is Mama
and wants your attention, and one is Dada
and wants your attention, potentially. It's not always that way.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Exactly. I just remember what we said in
the last episode, how the convention is
to have two parents. I mean nowadays it's
often only one. But it would be
fascinating to find out what else could
be possible, what that would mean for the
children and their development. So
if you want to get back on that topic
that would be great. Did you have any
more insights?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> My memory is terrible. I can't
always remember what we spoke about last time. But I do remember discussing
parentage and how interesting
it would be to raise various different
children from various different parents in a
culture of, say, just a family unit, I
guess, of say ten different parents, and
how broadening that would be for a child, in my opinion. It might be really
confusing. I don't know.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
haven't thought it through either.
Obviously you would get contributions
from more people, more personalities. That
sounds like a positive thing. But the big
question for me is what it would mean
for your sexual identity. I could see
there being a good purpose for having
one male and one female parent, so that
you can learn about the interaction of
the genders. We just don't know
what what else is possible, and what
consequences it would have.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Just to
clarify, because this is being me ignorant
here. In terms of sexual identity, do you
mean male or female, or do you mean you're
attracted to?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well I was at first going
for male or female. But of course, yes, the
attraction is a big factor as well.
That's part of it. Some people
call it orientation. But I think that word doesn't go deep enough.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's just definitions of words,
because this is a fascinating one. I always
remember back on...
If you're filling out a form, for example
for a job. It would say it
would say "sex: male or female", and now it
says "gender: male or female". That
happened in the last 10 or 20
years or so, where the definition has changed. It used
to be your sex was
male or female. That was
the term that was used. And now I think that
we used the term "gender", which is fine,
but I think people still think that sex
can mean gender, too.
I think they're trying to make it two
different things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, so are you one of
those people who likes the
differentiate between the two.
Would you like to define them?
Oh is
that complicated in itself?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Maybe, I don't want to think
about it too much. I think it has its place.
I think, like all things, 
when I think about like topics like this,
there is no right or wrong. It's just
what options people want. So if you want
to be called... you know your
sexual orientation is male, female or if your gender is
male or female, then go for it.
Who is anyone else to say "no" or
"yeah" to these things? Noone has as a
place to say.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. I don't mean
we're trying to be politically correct.
Just we're not trying to be confusing.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> We can define for
ourselves what we want those words to
mean, in the course of this episode.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think one way I would
interpreted it, and it's probably wrong because
I'm ignorant, is, to me, is what
you feel you are on the inside, I guess.
So that's just the way I define it. It's
probably not the current definition of.
But if I say my sex...
I'm a man because I have you know
testicles and penis, that
makes me a man physically. But
gender-wise I'm just human. So in
a way I probably identify as non-binary
in terms of, I guess, "Who am I?", in
terms of Stephen, the entity inside this
body, or the controller's body or whatever,
however you want to define it. I don't
see myself as male or female.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So this is
particularly relevant for transgender
people, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> For me
this is where this differentiation
became interesting the first time, you
know, because there people can have
the opposite feeling of what their body
is made of. It's very
interesting how anyone could actually
say that the thing inside of my body the,
I don't know if you want to call it
"spirit" or "mind", "being" does not
necessarily need to be male or female.
That's very interesting.
I personally have not thought about
that too much. The question has never come up.
Obviously different people are
confronted with different questions, and
at different times of their life. So
I'm going to think more about that one.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Again, going back to the young
age you talked about. I think that
culturally we're very bad at allowing
children to just experience who
they are, because you hear about things
like, you know, young boys will just want
to wear a dress. That's just what they enjoy. They like playing with towels or
whatever. For some reason that's just
such a big issue for a lot of people.
In a way we seem to be on a cusp of...  Well, we're in it.
We're in the revolution. We're in the
moment of this, and it lasts X amount of years,
where it is finally becoming acceptable
and okay, and realizing that that's just
a human being that's just exploring
things that actually don't matter: what clothes you wear. what toys
you play with. To think that
that's gonna have an impact
negatively or positively really. It just
is. It's just if that is what makes
the child happy, then whatever.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right. We
have strong expectations for children.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> We do. So much pressure.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And when they don't turn out the way we
expect, I don't know. I mean, I'm not a
parent myself. But I just see it around
me. It's also a topic in the
media sometimes, how when things don't go
according to tradition or expectation we
are disappointed. We take it
personally. We try to force our
expectation onto that child, and that is
just for the worse, it makes things worse.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It seems happen to a lot of fathers,
where they can
only really relate to other men. There seems to be a trend. Maybe it's false. But a trend
that I've noticed is that...
not always because I hate to
make absolute statements. But men tend to,
you know, not be as empathetic and
nurturing and etc. etc. as women if they
can't relate to women the same way women can
relate to women and men. Therefore when they
have a daughter they seriously struggle.
They're still loving and caring and
really, you know, protective. But
they don't know necessarily how to
relate, and they end up installing in them
so-called masculinity or their 
male ideology, like sports. You know,
you hear that all the time for America.
I don't know why this is. How I Met
Your Mother, that TV show, Robin, where she's
constantly like all laddish, and
this is the way that I was brought
up because of my dad. There's
a few examples in TV shows. I
don't know how frequent that actually is
in society. But I imagine is quite
prominent, where because you want to bond
with your child and if you only have
certain things you'd like, if they like
other things you don't feel like you can
relate. So therefore you want to find
something that you can connect to.
Because you're an adult and they're a
child you're more domineering therefore
you inflict your... it's easier to fit
your ideology of the child to your
child because it just wants to have your
approval all the time rather than going
down to the child's level and being like
"what do you want to do, and I'll learn
from you?"
I guess that shapes "Who am I?"
Then again to flip that to
the female side where mums I'm sure very
often when they have sons actually
sometimes, they perhaps wanted a
daughter, and therefore inflict a lot of
the feminine ideology
onto their children, their sons.

<div class="insertable" id="Oedipus.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> Let me get back to the Oedipus thing.
I was at the stage
of becoming a separate individual. But I
didn't get into the Oedipus part yet. So
around the age of three we, and and by
this time we've decided whether we are
like father or like mother, and in the
case of the boy he will feel sexually
attracted to his mother. And this is
called... this phase is named after Oedipus
in some Greek story because he, I mean,
even as an adult he was involved with
his mother and attracted to his mother.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The
interesting thing about our story is
that it's a false use of
him because he didn't know it was his mother.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right, okay.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So the prophecy was that he would... When he was born there was a
prophecy that he would kill his
father and marry his mother or whatever.
And then they abandoned him, and he went
off and lived his life. And he comes back
and no one knows who he is. He doesn't
know he is kind of thing, and then just
happens through circumstance to kill his
father and then marry his mother, but
didn't know that.
So it is an interesting misnomer. But
it works, the fact that obviously it's
used and it works. Freud used it. The
fact that there are some, whether
biological or cultural phenomenon, where
that can be the case, I guess.
Like all things, I never try to say it
is this way or it is that way. It is for
some people or others, or whatever.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Sigmund Freud.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> I wonder
whether Oedipus would like the way we
use his name now, the thing we connect
with his name or not.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Luckily the Oedipus thing
is just a story. As far as we're aware, it's not
actually... it's a myth, not a history, I
think.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay, I wasn't aware.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I love
my Greek nonsense. I'm pretty sure it was
a myth.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> But then again, you have
prime examples of this, what you're
talking about from the early age is, you
know, from the age of like 7, 8, you try to
copy your parents, even younger, having
boyfriends and girlfriends and stuff. And
you're already in that phase of trying
to find a life partner, I guess. Then
you've copied that from your parents.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So that would be elementary school.
Yeah, I remember there being, or even in
kindergarten, there were
relationships, or you know
pseudo-relationships.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> People were even getting married in
kindergarten.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Because that was
the epitome of adulthood, wasn't it. As a
kid you'd think, okay what you were taught that
getting married was the epitome of
being an adult. So
that's the thing you'd aspire for.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, little girls have their dolls and
their prams even sometimes. Because they
want to be a woman, and that's what it
seems to be about. 
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, because
that's what they see. It would be fascinating,
as culture changes hopefully more and
more, to see how
frequent that actually is in a society
where it isn't just pushed upon them
from a young age. Interesting.
