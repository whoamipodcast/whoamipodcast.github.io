<p><b>William:</b> Another
topic we could talk about in this
context is sexual orientation and, if
you prefer another term, I don't care.
I was told once by... she
was a stranger, but she was very open
when when I talked to her. We got
talking and she started
talking about her family and said that
her nephew
recently decided to be gay. And it was
something she didn't like. She was
disappointed, again,
maybe because that didn't feel the
expected role for a man. But what got me
was the the word "decide". And I thought
"Hmm, I only have a few gay friends, and I
don't get to talk about this topic a lot.
But from what I understand, it's not
something you decide. It's rather
something you discover or just go
through, I mean,
confront. It's not really not really
something you have power over." So it was
interesting, and all I could say to her
was "Um, yeah. Human development of
sexuality is very complex, and we don't
understand a lot about it."
So I wonder how that really comes about.
But it's best to just try to
understand the person.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, the "how" is I
guess less important than the acceptance
and love around that kind of thing.
Because I think people do focus too
much on the "why": "Why are you this
way?" Don't be so judgmental as a
culture. I had some weird but
fascinating experiences with it all.
Oobviously, going back to things
like terminology of
things, like masculine and feminine. And to the
emotions.
I was, during my teenage years, well during my early
childhood and teenage years,
very outwardly emotional person, would
cry at films, would get upset if someone
called me a name, would be very sensitive to
these things. And you know I processed
those and kind of learned to accept
those. Especially at university I was
amongst a bunch of young ladies, women,
with my friends that were fascinated by
this, that a man was okay just to be
expressive about his emotions. But
then I met a lot of people who
assumed I was gay. And it was fascinating
for me to be like, well first of all, to
be like "Okay, well, was I? Am I
actually gay, and is it a cultural thing
that I think I'm not gay, and it had
programmed me?" I
spent a lot of time thinking about that, and
came to the conclusion, you know, that
biologically I'm definitely attracted to
women and can appreciate a man, can
appreciate all forms of physical men.
But don't necessarily
want to kiss or hold hands or
whatever and have that connection with
men. With the emotional side of it: I
actually specifically remember being at
a party, and someone who was gay,
she was lesbian. And she used this
argument of me being quite emotional to
say that I was definitely gay. And I was
like "That doesn't work. Emotions aren't...
I don't
think emotions are... just because I have
a traditionally feminine sense of
emotion, why does it have to have a
feminine or masculine trait to it?"
That's complete different from sexual
orientation, or your personality
intention. You might actually be
attracted to the traditional masculine
traits of dominant... you
might be attracted to those things, but
those can be in both women or men.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So it doesn't dictate if
you are straight or not.
And it was just a very weird thing for
me to have to go through, and
assess and explain, I guess as well at
that stage.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> We have these snap
judgments, and we like to distance
ourselves from everything that doesn't
fit into our worldview, our very
simplistic worldview. And so people who
only have a very superficial
understanding of sexual development and
its later playout in life will just
quickly categorize you, "you" in the
everyone form.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Because we're all human. No matter how much we
think we're progressive or intelligent
or understanding, we're still really
ignorant a lot of things. We will
have blind sides, things
we think we
understand but we actually don't. And
it's figuring out which ones those are
to be able to to break down those
barriers and spend more time trying to
understand.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. My understanding of
these things has just grown slowly,
mainly by having friends who do not go
through the usual binary experience and,
you know, feel the same way for their
entire life, and then just not pushing
the topic but seizing opportunities
when it does come up to learn, to just
ask them or to just give them some space
to talk about it for whatever reason
they would like to talk about it, and
just trying to accommodate that new
knowledge. Because there's not much
to read about it, to watch about it. It is
in the media, and there are science books.
But it's not a
huge mainstream topic yet that it's
become total norm, just some part of
common sense basically.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's getting there, though.
It's getting a lot of shows, you
know, on TV and stuff:
"Orange is the new black", "Game of Thrones"
covered these things, just making it more
normal; it is in society. Because it has
always been there. It is a myth that
it's suddenly happening now.
No. It's funny. It's being accepted
more now, and it's given access to media
and and the mainstream, to normalize
it in the way that it should be, and not
be discriminated against. But throughout
history it has, because it's different;
it's not the majority. And therefore the
majority think it must be wrong. And
that's why they've had people who
are LGBTQ tend to have been discriminated
against. But now it's definitely
again... we're in the middle of this
wonderful time of acceptance and
love. You know about pride: it goes
around. Different marches and
discussions, especially amongst family
members. I hear a lot of things now
where when someone comes out the parents
are like "Oh yeah, that's fine. We kind of
suspected, or we knew." And the child's
like "Oh, okay. I thought you were gonna
freak out about this." Then you
have the opposite side, where you do get
parents that are obviously very cruel and very
horrible to those that have
come to a massive situation in their
lives of identity and courage to be able
to express that in a society that still
is judgmental at times, to have that
courage to do it, and then be
pushed away or disowned. It's horrible.
It's so bizarre.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Something I heard about
AI and homosexuality is interesting,
and I'd like to hear your opinion on
this. And I've only heard this,
but I'm sure I could look it up
somewhere. AI is supposed to be able to
just get someone's picture, just the
photo of their face, and be able to tell
with high accuracy whether that person
is gay or not.
And that's pretty crazy, given what
what you just explained about
the complexity of someone's identity. So how does
that work?
Do they somehow show it on the outside?
It's just a question from my side. I
don't know how much you want to talk about it.
Do you
think there are norms in society how
someone needs to present themselves
when they're gay or straight so that it
becomes obvious for other people?
I heard that men in the 70s and 80s wore
a earring in one particular ear, I don't
know which one, and that's that
disappeared. And nowadays, at least in the
media, some men will act very effeminately.
I think in most cases it's an
act. I suppose sometimes it's their
natural behavior. But from what I read
that outward effeminate behavior or
appearance is not correlated with being
homosexual as a man, at all.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. 
You can't make
statements like "it is this or it isn't this".
As always, it's
very much one personality will just be
more effeminate. They will want to
express themselves in a feminine
way by traditional rules of what
feminine actually is. But it's just
expressing who they are. They're just
being themselves. And they are being
allowed to be themselves. And then you
get many men who aren't that way, the gay.
You know, they're quite
happy in their jeans and t-shirt, doing
whatever. There's
no "this can define if"... No outwardly
thing can define. It can tell people.
It can show people. But I know some very
feminine dudes that aren't gay,
I mean in the traditional sense.
And so that's what the culture needs to
move away from. It needs to move away from
those stereotypes, I guess. I think so, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think ideally the
traditional genders should learn
from each other, should complement each
other. I think it's good that women in
the West these days have an expectation
of their male partners to be more
empathetic. And maybe there's
something similar in the other direction.
Well yeah, I suppose there is,not
necessarily because men want women to be
more in charge, but because
it's necessary. It's necessary for more women
now than it used to be a few decades ago
that they can sustain themselves
financially. Well it's also more possible
these days, obviously. I'm sure
they've always wanted to be more
independent. But that's becoming
more normal. And guys expressing their
feelings and just being more open for
their own feelings is becoming more
normal. I think that's a change in the
right direction. We don't need to be
the same as the other person, but we can
certainly learn from them and just be
open to their positive traits.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's looking at the traits
positive or negative. In any friendship or
even a relationship those aspects that
somebody else has that are more positive
in an area. You, for example:
You're better at questioning
things than I am. Sometimes I just go
along with things, and you
research, you question. And that's
something over time that hopefully I'll
adopt and will become part of my
personality. Because seeing it in you: "Oh yeah. Steven does this.
That's a good thing for me to kind
of adopt." And in any relationship,
in terms of romantic, you spend a
lot more time with that person.
Therefore it's more likely to
potentially have an impact. But there's
traits of personality. But the problem, I
find, and this is just my own personal
opinion of what I observed, is that usually
people adopt negative. So over time,
instead of adopting the positive, working
together to actually move, improve
themselves, I guess. But if you're trying to, I guess,
be a more productive, in society, human
being, in terms of kindness and
happiness and whatever; if that's your
goal, then if you were adopting those
personality traits that would be great. But
most people aren't actively trying to do
that. Therefore the instinct kicks in, and
just without realizing it, the more
domineering negative aspects seem to
just be adopted. Or one side just goes
quiet. So one personality in
the relationship just accepts whatever
the other person does and
just gets on with it. Because that is
easier.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It can happen that
people give up on evolving and improving
themselves, for many different reasons.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It sounds so pessimistic but
it's my observation with relationships,
where so many just end up splitting up or in divorce or
whatever; and it's usually because the
one person's negative personality traits
aren't being changed. They just get
worse and worse and worse, or highlighted.
It's not necessarily getting worse, but
highlighted by the other person's desire
to change or improve.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It becomes an
issue.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's why relationships are so complex,
because of those things. Because very few
people are actually trying to do that,
they're actually trying to change the
parts of themselves in a way that is humble and
non-judgmental. Because there's nothing worse
than to be judged, is there.
There's nothing worse than feeling like you're not good enough,
or you're wrong as a
person, like who you are isn't right. So
it can be very difficult in a
relationship, can't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right. So you want the
approval of your partner. But to get back
to the original topic, or to link it back,
you want the approval of your
parents. Right? Some people carry that
with them their entire life: that they
didn't feel valued enough by their
parents. And so they will live with
feelings of guilt or shame or
worthlessness for their entire lives
sometimes. So another way how we need to
split from our parents is in what
gives us value and purpose in life. We
need to become more independent in that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That responsibility actually should
lie with the parents. The parents should
be teaching children to think that way.
It comes back
to that, what we talked about, about there
being multiple... in a society if there was
multiple parents, they would be
able to give children more options of
how they view what a relationship should
be.
And it will almost force
the issue, I guess, of a child seeing
different relationships, rather than just
one, one relationship being its
primary observation.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well. It's been a fascinating
conversation. Obviously we can go a lot
deeper. I'm glad we were able to
just address these things. They've been
on my mind recently. I'm starting to just
looking for these things in the world
and trying to figure out more how I fit
in. How far am I in my own
development? Because there's always room
for progress. And I want that feeling of
Independence and self-worth that I
mentioned there in the end. I want to
stand on my own two feet and not depend
on someone else for just feeling like a full valid
valuable human being. So it's a very
old topic. It seems like everyone has to
go through it. And some make it through
unscathed, seemingly. But I often wonder
whether everyone has to go through
something like this in some form or
another, whether it's tied in with the
parents or gender or romantic
relationships.
I think everyone, sooner or later, is
confronted with some issue about
identity, whether it's biological,
sexual, emotional, mental. And I guess it's
just something that happens to everyone.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think the research that you do...
I mentioned a few
minutes ago about how you question; you
look for these things. Because for me talkking about things
like the Oedipus complex and stuff is
uncomfortable. It's trying
to understand these viewpoints from
psychologists a long time ago
and current, and how it relates to
me and my viewpoint on the world and
those kind of things. That's why I like
this podcasts and us chatting because
we're able to talk about uncomfortable
things. And it pushes the boundaries a
little bit. Again, uncomfortable for me because
I haven't looked
into it much. There's much that maybe I
should have done. Because I just accept
that, you know, I did have a bit of a,
as most people do, I guess, a broken...
I guess we all have this expectation of what
a family should be or a parent should be.
And once that smashed... It does
damage to us all when we realize that our
parents are just human; then we go through a
process of re-identifying selves and
what we think a parent should be or
is, that we take our parents just for who they
are and not what we think they should be.
I think that's a very
complex process that we go through
right from the get-go as a child. I
think subconsciously we're observing it.
As we get older we tend to think
that this parental expectation is what
we think it should be. And
then BOOM. We suddenly find out our
parents are flawed, and we can have a massive
psychological trauma. It can just
completely tear the fabric of
reality, because
that's your constant,
that's your North Star. You think your
parents are always going to be
there for you; and then
something happens where they're not.
Questioning lots of
different things, going back to different
psychological perspectives to help
understand the genesis of that. Because
we don't. Child
development is still, I think, a massive
area in psychology that is being still
being explored, even now, in making new
discoveries about how children learn and
are influenced. And then once we
understand those things you're more likely
to understand yourself now
because origins, I guess, are very
important for us.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. We like to raise our own
awareness and understand what is this
process we're going through. And I think
that's usually a positive thing.
Obviously it can be too much at once. But
taking it in little bites is usually a
helpful thing, to feel like we're more in
control of our own lives and making
deliberate decisions about the direction
we want to evolve in. With that last
comment I now want to have another
episode on parenting sometime.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, me too.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Because one big question that you
just reminded me that I have is "How far
along do you need to be in your own
personal development before you are
qualified to be a parent?"
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That is a good way of putting it.
I think
that sums it up right. That's a
good conclusion to end on.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, teaser.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well puts. You always put a good
question. You speak it very well.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> </p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> We need a little cliffhanger somtimes. We want people coming back.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah.
</p>
