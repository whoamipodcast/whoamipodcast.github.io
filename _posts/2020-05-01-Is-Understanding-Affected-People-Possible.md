<p><b>Steven:</b> And then
I got used
to it. I started to understand
the depressive spell. So if I was feeling very depressed I just knew
that's what was happening and I guess
pushed through it. And it became the
normal. It became just part of my
everyday life.
And most people would be like, "Oh, I
didn't realize you were so...", you know, if I
talked about it to someone,
"Oh, we had no idea. We know you
you project the
rebellious surface image. But you're
always so, you know, happy and look
positive." And it's amazing that you can
project that on the surface, but inside
be so in oblivion and
turmoil and feel hopeless, I guessm, because that's what depression can be.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, it can isolate you because you might
feel that you're the only one going
through this, or that there's something
wrong with you. And then you can feel
ashamed for it. And so I enjoyed going to
groups who share this. I don't think
there they were always available. But in
my late 20s I found a group that helped
me like that. Or I've also done a bit of
group therapy, and that's helpful because
everyone is different in how they
experienc mental illness; but there is
more of an understanding and less
prejudice and expectation for you.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, the emotion is the same. The emotion
is the same. So even though the
circumstances around things may be
different, often the thing that
links us is being able to meet people
that can relate and understand, to a
degree, the emotions we're going through.
I think we've talked
about this before in the podcast. But
often you get people to say, "Oh, you can
never say you understand." In a therapy
situation the therapist should never say
they understand because they don't. And
it's like well actually no they may
understand the emotional side of it. They
may not understand the circumstances. And
when I've been talking to friends and
stuff, it's when they... if
they're having struggles, and I
turn to them and talk and say, "No I
understand the emotion and how that's
going through," they feel less alone. It's
a very important thing to feel less
alone. Feeling alone is
one of the biggest triggers or
struggles with any mental health thing.
The moment you kind of get a sense of
not being alone I think it takes a bit
of a weight off. So you finding a group
that you can actually you know chat to
and stuff is wonderful, it's being able to help.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, you did mention that about empathy
and being able to feel what other people
are feeling even though you might not be
in the exact same circumstances as them
in a previous episode. But the emotions
that come with mental illness can be
different or more intense in a way. So
what words can you use to describe
them? I mean the word "depression" gets
misused a lot like, "I was so depressed
all day, but now I'm fine." That could be
real depression, but often people just
use it for when they're down a bit, when
they're disappointed. But there is a
medical use obviously.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, again the
measurement: When does it turn
from being down and feeling unhappy to
then being depressed? That's
the difficult weight of the doctors
struggle with I guess, to try and measure, to know.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I find it to be literally
depressive, sometimes in the sense that
there's something pressing. You know,
there's a pressure in my head. And I
don't know how that works physically, if
there is air pressure, if there's blood
pressure, I don't know what other things
there could be.
There's some electrical phenomenon going
on. But it also manifests in my
shoulders. So the feeling of there being
a burden on my shoulders I guess comes
from the tension in my shoulders when
I'm trying to protect myself metaphorically,
as though there were someone
chasing me with a stick or something.
Maybe that's some instinct we have when
we feel endangered, threatened. So that's
that's another word I like to use to
describe how I feel. And then just lots
of irrational thoughts, including fears
of dying; I think that's a common one,
going to hell if you're raised in a
religion. You know just just these these
worst fears that you have that you might
experience in your nightmares will
appear so much more realistic.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You just feel
overburdened by everything, everything.
Everything manifests itself a lot
stronger, as you say. And I think
motivation is one as well, like to be
able to do things becomes very
difficult. Even simple tasks become
a clear sign, I think, that you're
struggling with depression. Again,
a lot of people don't realize a lot people go through a depression.
And they kind of just push through
and push through. You know, things are a
lot harder. It takes them a while to
realize what's actually going on. And so
it's important to try and make people
aware, I guess mainstream culture. All
these things ... receive
the help.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I found that I'm afraid of
disappointing someone, say an employer or
a parent. And then I will try to hide my
feelings because of that,
because I want to fulfill the
expectations the other person has.
But the the paradox thing is that
they're actually more prepared than you
think to be understanding, even if they
may not have gone through anything
similar personally, but to just treat you
more carefully, more respectfully. I think people are
capable of being careful and friendly if
they know that there's a need. But first
you need to tell them. Because, like you
said earlier, a lot of us hide what we're
going through and do so successfully. A
therapist will probably pick up on these
signals a lot quicker...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The depression itself makes it feel like you
can't tell people. So you feel like a
weakness, or that you're you're not good
enough, or that you're failing. And
therefore you think you're
gonna be judged and think that you'll be
letting them down, as you say, and disappoint
them and stuff; when as you say it's
quite the opposite: Often people are
willing to help because they care for
you and want what's best for you. But it's
hard to take that first step,
that first step is quite frightful.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The opposite can happen, too, that someone
wants to help you. But since they don't
know what you need, what would actually
help you, they're very likely to do
something that is not helpful, that could
even be counterproductive, and put more
pressure on you. And then all you want is
distance from that person. But
then if you're the affected one you
often don't know yourself what you need.
And so the the common thing for me is
just rest, just leave me alone and let me
sleep, and then I'll be better afterwards,
more approachable or in a better mood.
But when it's a person I see regularly
maybe I could figure out something with
them where I can say, "I'm in a bad mood or having one of those
days," and then they know how to treat me
differently. But that's something, that
takes time, and you just need to figure it
out.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, people tend to be one of two
things: they tend to be fixers or
listeners. So one person tends to just
listen and let someone
talk and work through it themselves. And
then other people tend to want to
just be proactive, give you the
advice that may or may not help or be
worse or actually might be the right
thing. But again, it all depends on the
individual and the conversation going on
and that kind of stuff. But that tends to
be what I found. And at any given time it
could be the right or wrong thing. It's
so difficult. So one person that you're
talking to that maybe has depression or
anxiety or, with OCD it's actually is a bit
more complex in terms of trying to find
things to help and assist with it. But with
depression and anxiety there are many many
ways like both medication or cognitive
behavioral therapy and different
therapies that can assist. And it's
trying to be able to talk, when you're
fun to an individual, signpost some, I
guess, listen obviously, but do both I
guess: listen, make sure they know that
they're cared for, and that they're not just being
brushed aside as, "Just get over it,
get on with it." That's an attitude that
happens, and then signpost it, I guess, to
doctors and different things.
Meditation is one that happens a lot
these days.
Talk about mindfulness and these kind of
things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There's no shame in going to a
regular general practitioner or a
psychotherapist just to figure out if
you are dealing with such a condition,
so that you can give it the proper
attention. Another method that I like to
use is reading self-help books. They
may not answer every question you have.
Obviously you can't have a dialogue with
them with the doctor. But for
me, I love to absorb information and
learn a lot. So it's a good way
for me to reduce that uncertainty and
that feeling of being overwhelmed. So
a combination of medicine, therapy
and books and meditation is good.
The combination is usually better
than any of them by themselves. What
has been bad for your healing process?
One thing I can think of that also
others have told me is trying to search
the internet for advice by other people
who have been through something similar, you know, non-professionals.
Have you done
that before?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, a little bit. I've been
quite lucky to find people that actually
I can just chat to. And they're getting
such a strange like interesting one
getting tested is through messaging. So
often that works for people often
messaging backs and forwards. There are a
lot of communities where it can help
often do the opposite, and it just
becomes a cesspool of people feeding off
each other's depression rather than help
each other. That can happen.
