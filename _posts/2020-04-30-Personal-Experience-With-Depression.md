<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, we have both had plenty of
experiences over the years. This is the
type of thing that can last half a
lifetime or more, I don't know.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It often
feels like several lifetimes, doesn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, it can make things harder to go
through. But we also want to get to the
positives, because there are some. I think
everyone has hard things in their life,
and for some people, or for a lot of
people, it's mental illness. I think more
people then we often realize are
affected, because it's something that
everyone likes to keep quiet. There's
this expectation for us to be always in
a good mood, always approachable, always
ready to talk to people, ready to work,
always have enough energy, at least
that's what it can feel like when those
things are no longer available.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There is a lot of expectation. And I find
it very strange. I've always
been confused by this
measurement of ability for us to
work or do things. It's measured by the
person or people that can do the most. So
for example if someone can work for 12
hours or go running for ages,
I should have more of the work stuff,
then everyone else is expected to be the
same. But biologically we're all so
different. We're all so... the
variation is unreal. Snd therefore why do
we expect that everyone's going to be
able to measure up the same high
standard?
It's very strange. I've always been
fascinated with that. And it always
affects... well I always get
confused. But not everyone can do
exactly the same as everyone else.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Maybe schooling is a big factor: that
we all get it graded the same way.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, that's
true.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But then some differences are made.
Some schools will be more okay
with someone having dyslexia for
example, and then treat them slightly
different in how they're graded, or what
courses they go to. So there is some...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's progress.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, there's some adaptability
there. But yeah, it's difficult. And
another reason you just reminded me of
is: usually the younger we are, the
more simplistic our worldview is. And we
keep learning, especially when we're
small children. We just soak up a lot of
knowledge about the world. We're a big
sponge, and then if we keep it up, if
we do the work, we can keep adaptable and
change our perspective of the world and
how it works, how other people work. And
that helps keep down the expectations we
have for other people and probably
ourselves as well. You know, it would
be nice to treat everyone individually,
but we always
make rules, abstractions away from the
reality. We create this model in our
mind of the world and of what people are.
And sometimes that then creates an
expectation for everyone to be the
pattern that you have built in your mind.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And mental health just defies all
that: patterns and expectations and
whatever, because again it's so different
from each individual person to person.
And we can have
similar... we can bracket it under depression
or anxiety or OCD or bipolar. There's so
many different things. But again,
quantifying it from individual to
individual is very difficult because we're all very
different.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The science is still pretty
young. The doctor does not have a lot
of symptoms to go on. There are tests
with those things stuck to your head, for an EEG for example.
That way they can measure
epilepsy. But yeah, a lot of things cannot
be measured materially, objectively. And
so there are surveys, there are forms
that where you can fill in your personal
perspective of what you're going through.
And that might help. But it is subjective.
I don't know. Personally, when I
get to know someone, after a while I will
pick up on some things that I associate
with depression, or, I don't know,
isolation, you know all these small
signals that you notice after a while,
especially when you've been
dealing with the matter yourself or with
someone close to you from day to day. And
then you become more adept
picking up on those signals. And I think
that's one of the most sure ways to
know what someone is going through from
the outside.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's difficult to
notice this shift
sometimes when you around people that
have depression. For example when they take a
bit of a dive and feel worse, then it's
hard to notice because you're kind of
like, "It's a case of depression. They've been
getting through it. It becomes normal." But
the examples of like Robin Williams and
Chester Bennington who was the lead singer
for Linkin Park.
They were known to have
depression in their personal lives, and
their families and they brought joy and
laughter and goodness to people's lives.
But on the surface
they showed all that happiness and
everything. But inside they were
really suffering and in turmoil, and it led them to taking their own lives.
And it's difficult to notice when, if
you're around it a lot, people take that
dip. But, so again, that 
measurement is very difficult. You know,
as you say, it's a personal thing
each individual has. And it's not like...
It's still a physical thing in many
ways. But it's not like a broken leg or classed as physical conditions.
They're easily defined. 
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I imagine someday
we will be better at physically telling
the symptoms. You know, brain
chemistry is not yet well researched. But
we have some theories about neuro...
What are they called. The receptors, the gap where serotonin jumps from
one cell to another. We have
some knowledge some theoretical
models of the activity between neurons,
the serotonin and the other things that
jump from cell to cell. But it is hard to
measure and not clear how to classify
someone's condition from that. But we
want to get more into the emotional,
social, everyday part of it anyway.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I have a question for you, if that's OK.
When did you first realize
that you were struggling with depression?
I don't know if that's too personal or not.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's fine. It's really difficult, well
it was really difficult for me to judge
when I was depressed, because I was so
used to it. I thought it was the normal
thing, it was just maybe obvious that I
was not as physically active as others,
not as excitable by sports or food, you
know things that give you excitement in
general in people. But I think you have
to really hit some wall before you can
be sure that you're going through a
mental illness, condition. And I
think that was when I was 10 for the
first time, when my family moved to
England. And it was really difficult for
me to adapt. I did find friends. I could
speak the language. But I missed a lot of
things about Germany. And it just made me
more sad than it should, or than you
would expect.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Simply change.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, but I
adapted and it was fine for a while. And
then again when I was 14 or 15 I noticed
that some little things that people do
bother me.
And then someone who I spoke to, just
voluntarily, helped me in my parents to
recognize that it's OCD. And so
we kind of managed. I didn't feel
comfortable with therapy. So we left it.
And then I came back at a later age. And
so it went in cycles like that. But every
time it got worse until I really could not
do any work, could not focus on anything,
some days could not get out of bed. Then
it becomes really clear.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, that's when it becomes obvious,
isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Was it similar for you, that it
was really a shock or a surprise?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
As you say, it's hard to sort of
pinpoint. So as a child I was
happy-go-lucky. I was literally
known for being a bit of a
hurricane, of just playing football,
running around, reading the odd book here
and there, but just being what
you'd call (again I hate the word but)
a normal, active child. But then when I hit
puberty at
twelve, thirteen
I just noticed a massive dip in the ability... well it was just
highs and lows. So I'd be
happy about something, and then the next
day I would just literally want to die.
The compulsion to just end my life
would just kick in. It's almost this
constant depressive force of, "What's the
point? The world is so cruel. Blah, blah, blah."
Stuff that just would be depressive.
And I think, you know, I struggled to
relate, I guess like all teenagers
probably all humans, to a lot of things,
and it just left me feeling very lonely,
like super alone. And I turned to
music for myself, to get help me get
through things. I realized that there
was definitely a depression. But I think I
hit it pretty well as well, because we
get used to masks, we put on masks.
So I think it was obvious that I was
into rock music, metal music,
these kind of things that people
associate with often getting depressed, but
sort of normal society. But that made me happy. This is the
interesting thing: because the
music was relatable to I didn't feel so
alone. So therefore I actually felt
happier because of that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Was it about the
lyrics, or kind of the rebellious tone?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, deeper thinking. I guess a
lot of pop music is
very shallow. So then I found... It's typical cliche: big
brother gives you personal music. It
becomes your sort of go-to. And yeah it
was Metallica, Offspring, Slipknot at the
time, Linkin Park, and it was just, Korn.
And they were just bands
that would just... I was into extreme
things. So I enjoyed the heaviness. It was
so different to what I was used to. But as
you say, the lyrics often just made me
feel the emotion in a relatable way. So
I'd feel depressed. They talk about
depression, they talk about suicide,
or they talk about being angry. And it's
just things that I was like, "That's how I
feel. I didn't have anyone I could talk
to about it."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That makes sense.
</p>
