<p><b>Steven:</b> Hi there. This is Steven from the podcast
"Who am I?" Just a sensitivity warning:
Today's subject is very complex and can
be very difficult at times to talk about
and hear about. If you're not feeling in
the right frame of mind to listen to a
discussion about depression, then
we encourage you to just wait until you
feel you are. Also we have a few
technical issues where the screen
freezes a few times, just you know
technology the way it is. So bear with us,
and we hope you enjoy the podcast. And
today's episode is gonna be discussing
mental health and how it affects us
personally and just in day-to-day life.
I guess we will start the discussion off
just by really talking about our own
experiences.
