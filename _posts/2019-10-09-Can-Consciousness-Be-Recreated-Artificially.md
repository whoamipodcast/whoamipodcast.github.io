<p><b>Steven:</b> And, I guess, linking it back to
the robotics side of things, where that's
what we're exploring as a humanity:
projecting our, I guess, our desire to
discover who we are as beings
by creation, because that's pretty much
how we will always do it, and creating a
machine robot that reflects ourselves is
a way to explore ourselves, because
you're creating something that is like
you or like us as a species. I
guess you'd have to do it, again, I don't
do robotics, but you'd have to get and go
through so much data, so much, you have to
understand so much philosophy, so much
emotions. You have to understand...
It hurts my head, trying to think about
it... then be able to create something like
that, that does it by itself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But, so when
you do create something that behaves
similarly to you, or to a human in
general, then I think the next step
is that you believe that what you did to
make this machine the way it is is the
same that made you who you are. I
remember when... This blew
my mind the first time I sat in a
lecture about logic in computer science,
and I realized that the formulas, the
logical formulas that we're writing down,
explaining something mathematical, just
not as complex as something
about human behavior; just something
in math, something abstract... I thought "okay
this describes the behavior. But at the
same
people believe that this IS the behavior.
That this is what generates the
behavior in the first place." But I
believe that there's still a step in
between, and that they might just seem
the same but they don't have to be the
same.
Does that make sense? hen I say, when
I say "oh, you seem to drink orange juice
every second day", and I watch you. Say 
this is with someone I live with so that
I get I can notice this really every day.
And then so I set up this rule. I can
write it down mathematically if I want
to. Every second day this person drinks
orange juice, and the other days
they don't, but usually you don't have to
say that. Anyway, now does the
person do that because they had a rule
written somewhere inside of their brain
that that is what they do? Or is it that
they they drink orange juice every time
they feel sad and that's just how
they deal with it? And for some totally
different reason they feel sad; it's just
a coincidence that they feel sad every secon day.
So the rule is "let's do
something totally different, but..."
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Where did the rule come from? Is it wired into our being? Is it a
consequence of variables throughout the
past of their existence? So it wasn't
necessarily why I did again environment
type factors that can change at any point
in life. Or is it, as you say,
they've just consciously decided? "Well
okay, I just wanna... I'm gonna have it
every other day because that's it we're
gonna stick to." To me, I mean it's more, but it's, to me there's
three different things going on there.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay. I already forgot the first two. So
tell me: environmental factors?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The first one is
hardwired into their system.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So DNA, genetics, whatever, coded... who
knows that there's something in there that
was gonna make them always get to the
point where they were gonna have orange juice
every second day.
Or they go through life and just think
things happen, environment, external factors.
Maybe, like you say,
their mom used to do it every second day.
Who knows. They decided that they... that's more of a
philosophy.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And the third
one was conscious choice.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Conscious
choice: that kind of crossed over there a little
bit from environmental conscious choice.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, they're not totally clearly
divisible.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I'm trying to divide something
that isn't actually, you know, separated
out so I can understand those three
different points, but actually they all
intertwine. whatever.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So it is really
useful though. The first two points are
very similar to the nature versus
nurture debate.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, that's the obvious
one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And the third one is relevant for
our discussion about consciousness and
free will, because certain people, I mean
a lot of people, believe that conscious
decision-making is just an epiphenomenon,
it's just something that we tell
ourselves exists, but actually it's just
an illusion; and everything we do is
predictable or, what's the other word,
determined, so that our behavior is
deterministic. And machines are
deterministic, at least the way they are
right now.
You say one day they might not be, and
that's interesting. But yeah, it's
really difficult to know how I make
decisions. You could say... You can reduce
a lot of what I do back to something
else in the past, like the way I was
raised.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The things already mentioned; or
just how I work. And I do a lot of things
without consciously knowing that I'm
doing them, like I heard once that you
are attracted to someone if when you
kiss your saliva chemically harmonizes.
Or just pheromones that you give off,
you can like them about someone else and
then you're attracted to them. So there are all
these factors that you don't know are
working on you, and they influence your
decision-making. So things like that
certainly show that there is truth to
this unconscious decision-making. But
does it mean that everything works that
way? I think that would be too far-reaching and, again, extrapolating from
the knowledge you do have to "oh this is
how everything works".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. I
always find important not to jump to
absolutes; again, just one thing I've learnt
from Dune, where you say THIS is how it
is. Well no, this is how I believe
it is, but there's a
hundred different factors that I'm
going to absorb, listen to, take on
board that can also be right, or
could be part of the equation.
Right and wrong very absolute terms,
trying to express the variation of
the situation. It's difficult.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, I
think it's a matter of arrogance or
humility. At least once you have
reached a point where you become aware
that you're aware. That's
critical too. So if you think about
children, they do a lot of things out of
necessity, just automatically, basically.
But something will change, and it's a
process,
I don't know if it can happen all of
a sudden.
But when they become aware how their
decision-making works and that they can
actually change what they want to do...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Isn't it in the test, the sweet test.
You put a child, honestly, a
table, and you give them sweet in front
of them, and you say "if you wait ten
minutes you get two sweets", And the
child just sits there; and most children just eat the one sweet because they feel
the necessity just... they're like "this is
good now. I love it."
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Marshmallow Experiment.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> Is it important for
the test that you leave the room?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. I
think so, yeah. They're on their own with
the sweet.
I think it's again it
does many different things. But I think, again,
it shows what you just said,
where you learn a point where you
actually, you can override the conscious
impulse to eat the good thing or sugar
egg, to realize that you
get something better if you wait or
something, it's a better, a positive outcome
if you just wait. Because I think that's what a lot of choices are. I think
a lot of choices are action and
reaction. It's something happens to you
and you automatically respond. It's
putting up a wall in my, again, this is my opinion, that free will is where you're
able to put up a wall and go "okay, just
pause for five seconds and do a bit
of conscious choice-making, to then
make the decision, to then do what you
want to do. Because again, it's not necessarily about what is
right or wrong, it's what you as an
individual want to do in that situation.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You might want to go and punch the
person, that's an example
here, is if you're in an argument or
something, and your impuls is, let's say,
fight, fight or flight. And in
the past it seems you've just done it out of
impulse. You hit the person and then
you got in trouble, or whatever, or you've not. If you can get the point where you
can go "No, I don't want to hit the person",
walk away or "Yes, I do want to do it" and
then still do it; that shows a conscious
choice-making situation, again, in my
view, my little naive view.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You know, I
think that's really a good perspective
for this topic. It's easy for us to look
at children and say "oh they've just made...
they've just taken a step to another
level of consciousness", and then it helps
to, when I remind myself that I'm not
that different from children. I've made
certain changes but I can still make
lots and lots of changes. So I'm just on
one of the many steps on this staircase
towards higher and higher consciousness, you could say. I also love that you
used the word "respond". I can respond
to the situation, I mean impulsively, or I
can just, you know, react without knowing
why or how. Or I can choose how to
respond. And the word responsibility
comes from "respond", because I have the
"ability to respond". I am response-able. And
so that is a power that you can
gain. I'm not sure how exactly the process
works. But you can certainly decide to be
open for it. And then with experience and
just trying over and over you can gain a
higher level of responsibility, of awareness.
And I think that's a very valuable thing
to work on.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Definitely. On the flip side,
just to throw a contradictory example,
discussion out there, is you can spend
too long thinking and worrying about
things. You can
over-analyze. A lot of my anxiety
and depression problems come from that.
They've come from just sitting there and
thinking too much about a situation and
not just letting my own impulses do the
thing. Because sometimes
I'm like "Okay, is this the right way? Is this
the wrong way?", in the past. Now I just go
to that core thing of what do I want,
what makes me happy? And then I just do it.
And if it goes wrong or seems to go
wrong I'm like "meh, whatever it doesn't
matter. It's what I wanted to do. I tried
it." I have that integrity and that
happiness that I did it. No matter what happens
that went or what goes wrong. I'm like
"Wow, yeah. Go me. I had the consciousness
to just do what I thought would help me
be happy."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The non-useful
thoughts, do they go in circles? Is that
what you're talking about?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> They can do, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You try to analyze and be
all cognizant, but it never leads
anywhere.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, yeah.
Again, that's where children come in.
I mean, you're example of
humility links back to kids because
you're showing you're humble by looking at
them as an example, because we're not
much different from them. We are not-
We think as adults we think we've
suddenly become this higher being than
those, the universe and knows how much
more in children. But children just
they are such prime examples of so
many different things, and fun, fun and
play. We talk about last time or
talked about it befor where, yeah, just it was
last time: being able to play is a
great way to learn, just having fun and
not overthinking things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> CBT stands for cognitive behavioral
therapy, and the cognitive therapy part
is the self-analyzing. trying to figure
out what's going on, thinking about
your own thoughts and seeing how you can
change those patterns, to help. But
behavioral part is what you're just
talking about, at least I believe that's
what behavioral therapy is about: how you
just need to do something sometimes; just
act out what you believe to be right or
what you believe to be healthy in the
moment, without knowing it in theory, you
know, in your brain. And both are
necessary for mental health or for
health in general.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> A lot of it is to do with fear
fear, of getting it wrong or making a
fool of ourselves, or whatever the
reasons that we prefer just to think
about it and go through it in our brains.
And again, in our brains we... often it
lies to us. It tells us things like
this social situation is gonna be scary
or whatever. And in many ways it's a self-fulfilling
and prophecy where, because you think
it's scary, your brain
releases the biological side of things, yeah, anxiety; when actually if
you just went and did it, and didn't think about it,
you'd be like "okay, cool this is fun or
whatever else".
That's what I got stuck in way back. But again, I
keep trying to refer this back to the
original sort of questions about
robotics. Do you think that they
could make a machine, I guess, express
what we're expressing, because you know more about
these things than I do.
Expressing awareness of fear?
Awareness of fun through learning?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Let me give you a high-level
answer that doesn't go into so much
detail. The first thing that jumps to my
mind is Kurt Gödel. Have you heard of
him? He was a mathematician in the 30s, at
least that's when he made
his huge contributions. He was a
party-pooper.
I like
to call him that because people at the
beginning of the 20th century were so
excited about all these new discoveries
about logic. So you know we're excited
about technological advances in the last
few decades. But they were excited about
the theoretical advances about
understanding math and logic better and
what you can write down on paper about
nature. So do you see the link, yeah?
You first need to understand these things in
theory before you can recreate them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Definitely.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="David Hilbert.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> David Hilbert, at the turn of
the century came up with, I don't know,
15 problems or so that he formulated for
scientists in the 20th century and he
said if you have nothing to work on, try
one of these. And there were really
difficult problems. You can look on
Wikipedia which of them have been solved,
which have't been solved.
Sorry?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think I've heard of those.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Kurt Goedel.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> Good. And I think maybe a third of them
are solved, and that's about it. But one
of them was: can you describe everything
that happens in the universe
mathematically? And people believed yes.
They were very optimistic about this
problem. And then Kurt Gödel came along
and he showed that "Nope". He
didn't have to go through every possible
situation and show, and find one that
doesn't work. He showed that
mathematically in itself, mathematics in
itself is incomplete. It doesn't mean
it's wrong or useless. It just means it
has its limitations. For example,
when you create a formula, when you write down
a formula that is trying to express
something about itself, and this is
similar to a machine trying to think
about itself,
it's analogous, in theory it's
the same. When you, when you try to do
that it is possible, but only to a
certain extent. Because there are certain
formulas, mathematical formulas, that will
express something and you can derive it
to be true from basic truths. I'll give
you an example of some of the logical
steps that you can make in mathematics:
modus ponens is a rule that is
when you have two rules one of them says
if A then B, and the second one says A
which means A is true; and the first one
says if A is true then B must be true. If you combine the two if you say
that both are true then you can know as
a consequence that B is true.
You know that A is true and
we know that if A is true then B is true.
If you combine the two you get B, or B
is true. So that's one basic rule that
most people most scientists can agree on
in most situations it holds true. You can
come up with some quirky situations but
it doesn't, but let's stay in the
common sense area. And so you have a set
of these, maybe a dozen. And you you can
express infinitely many very complex
things about nature or any mathematical
system. And the the logic
will be consistent for that. If X is true
then it's negation must be false, right?
If I say
sun is shining and it is, then the
sentence "the Sun is not shining" must be
false. But with the mathematical
logic that we have, that we're using
right now. the standard arithmetics, you
can derive a sentence, the system will
predict that the sentence is true and
that its negation is true.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So, I
don't remember how, I looked at a proof
once. It's complicated. But Kurt Gödel
came up with this in the 30s and
showed that the mathematical system has
been very useful, but it has its
limitations, because obviously something
and it's negation cannot
always be true at the same time. And so
that shows that No, that the
mathematical system we were using right
now is not able to cover everything. We
cannot express everything with it. And
that to me is fundamentally important
because it shows that there are still
things outside of the very system,
the language, the mode of thinking
that we use to make sense of nature, our
environment and ourselves. Sp I hope
that you can see the connection
between that discovery and your question
about self conscious machines. As long as
we build machines based on the
mathematics we use right now, I believe
that they will at least be limited.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You might be able to create zombies.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well we're limited as well, so. So I guess our limitation
creates the limited
machine. Therefore we need
to improve our own limitations
to be able to create.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The last thing we
said was
humans are limited in our thinking
in our scientific methods. And then you
said that then it's no surprise that the
machines that we create are also limited.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And that makes a lot of sense since,
I believe, you need to be at a higher
level than the thing you create because
basically you need to be able to create
everything it does, you need to be able
to understand everything it does.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Interesting point, because again, creation
often happens through accident, I guess. like just random chaos, I guess. I
don't think people realized exactly what
they're doing when they split the atom. I
mean,
maybe they did. I don't know. But
is it something they planned for?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There are examples that what
you're talking about. Like penicillin was
discovered accidentally.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, so leaps in
technology can... that's where,
again, all the I guess
disaster films come from where it's like
"do we jump forward in robotics?" It's the
point where we actually create something
that is beyond us. And then...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> We
should definitely discuss that another
time.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think it would be a good part two. I think this
is a good ongoing discussion
that could quite easily take up
another session.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Of course, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So if you
want to...
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Mark Zuckerberg.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> Some people call this topic "AI
safety". Elon Musk is a big proponent
of being more careful and not just going
for every idea you have. Especially
people do that when there are economic
incentives behind it. He had a fight, you
could say, a debate with Mark Zuckerberg
on Twitter once. But they went back and
forth what is safe to do? When
should you be more careful and not care
so much about all the money that you
could make just because you're the first
to try this new approach?
Yeah, it's a big
topic.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It is, it really is.
Have you felt like you've
discussed a lot of what you wanted to in
this session?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, obviously it
evolved organically, just
like you predicted. And I didn't expect
to go into mental health or some of the
history of mathematics. But it's all
related, obviously. So yeah, I'm very happy
with the way it's gone. And we could
spend another hour on it, which would
definitely make another episode.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I'm happy to do that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Good. What do you think about the idea of
sometime in the future also getting on
someone else to speak with us or with
one of us about a topic?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. I'm always
yeah like I mean, I just kind of just
talked about limitations like it's
always good to get another viewpoint. It'd be
nice. Wouldn't it be amazing if we can link
up you know seven billion
people and get a lot of different
perspectives together? But again,
limitations; so having someone else that
has a perspective and knowledge and is
always good fun, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It doesn't have to
be an expert, just another voice that
brings some diversity.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. Again,
we're not exactly experts.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, you are in many things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well,
I studied certain things, and you could
tell I'm really excited to talk about
them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And I'm happy to have this
outlet, this way to express them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I like
listening to them. I've always went...
In our previous discussions. I've
lost number of years. I've really
enjoyed because we were very different
in our own knowledge base, I guess.
I guess that's what happens as
humans. But just you have such a
incredible understanding of, again, the coding,
computing language and how it relates
to humans, to us. And you do a
very good job of humanizing it all.
Because a lot of times I separate myself
from that kind of stuff because to me it
feels so foreign to how my own
perspective perceives things, that it seems
unhuman. But actually the way you break
it down and talk about it really helps
me to open my mind more to that. I
think I still very rarely
understand it, but it just gives me a
little bit of knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
know what I mean, yeah. I think it's
sad when people strictly try to separate
the science from what it means for us in
everyday life. And humanization is
important, like the ethics question for
example. That should always come along
with the scientific development. You
shouldn't just do something because it's
fun or because there's lots of money in
it. Progress isn't always all good, or
at least you should say there are
different types of progress.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, again,
it's intention, isn't it. Ontention behind
the progress.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, and the
unintended consequences that you need to
repair afterwards...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Which, I guess, is a
good link. Right there actually. 
That question could be our starting
point for next session: the
intentions behind creating, again,
machines that have consciousness and
affect our day-to-day lives potentially.
And (1) why you want to do that? And (2)
should we do that? (3) Is it
she worthwhile? These things we can
discuss, I guess.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Definitely, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> To start
with. Maybe you have our
ideas. But just...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, I have tons of ideas,
just in response to the things you were
saying. But I'd better write them down, and not try to cover them all now.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There we go.
</p>
