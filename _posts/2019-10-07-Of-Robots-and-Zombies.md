<p><b>William:</b> Okay, today my suggestion for a
topic of discussion is self-awareness.
For example, you can look at it from the
perspective of artificial intelligence
or robotics, if you will. How are humans
different from robots? I really love
reading Isaac Asimov.
He's my favorite author, and he is known
for writing lots and lots about robots.
He is, in my mind,
similar to Tolkien. Whereas Tolkien built
this whole planet, continent, you know,
with
lots of different creatures, languages,
scripts, fauna, flora, Asimov created a
galaxy in the future. And it's so far in
the future that Earth has become a myth.
This one planet where human life
started. And in some of the stories
people try to find out where it was by
looking into really old texts. But anyway,
that's a tangent.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You go ahead. Because, again, I
haven't read as much Asimov as I
would like. So hearing what it's about
actually from you, it'll be
educational for me and I'm sure for the
readers as well.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Which books or
movies are you familiar with?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So I have... this is going to be difficultbe cause my memories are so bad.
The most famous one, I
haven't read much of that one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The foundation series.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, foundation series.
I jumped into one at first to try...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Empire series, robot series.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It might
have been the robot series.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Ok, yeah, that's probably the most known one.
Or
next to Empire, next to foundation at
least.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I heard of it being really good.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There's lots of short stories in one
compilation, and the movies come from
that series: I Robot and the Bicentennial
man. Yeah, and so in those movies and many
of his books he deals, or the the main
person, deals with questions like "is this
a robot?". Similar to that film with
Harrison Ford.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Bladerunner.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, where he thinks
he has the test to know whether someone
is human or a robot. And you find out
just how tricky that can be. And so this
is a popular topic in sci-fi, one of
the reasons I love sci-fi.
And it's not just a computer science
question, but also a philosophy question.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. It's a humanity question?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Humanity?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, humanity question.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's interesting that humans
want create machines in their own image,
first of all. Why do machines have to be
humanoid? Our shape is really useful
for lots of things, but not all things.
And so there are machines in other
shapes as well, obviously. But it's
interesting how much we want machines to
be like ourselves. And so in some of
these stories by Asimov he allows, or
he writes without his machines his
robots become so much like humans that
the question gets more and more difficult: what's
the difference? In one of them a
robot man falls in love with a human
woman and tries to become more and more
human, a bit like data in Star Trek,
except that he really succeeds. His maker
is really helpful, keeps updating his
biology, I want to say, his anatomy. There
you go. And in the end there is no
more significant difference. I won't
spoil the end: what was the very last thing that
he that he needed to change to become
human? But the Bicentennial man was
granted human status: a civilian of
humanity, or a citizen of humanity. And so
but that's really interesting. What does
it take? And since they're fiction I
don't know how close they are to reality.
But we are certainly going in a similar
direction of making machines more and
more similar to humans.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It seems to be
the peak goal: okay we can make
computers, we can make machines. But the
goal by science and computing and all
that seems to be to make a machine that
can be a human, that can be classed as
human in nature, human in being, human
in looks.
It would be interesting to know why
exactly that actually is, why we so
strongly desire a lot of...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> A lot of
scientific research is not just about
analyzing and understanding aspects of
nature, but then also recreating it
and simulating it. And then you compare
it with nature and see how close you can
get. So I am in natural language
processing, for example. And there we try
to understand language which you could
say is nature. We use it every day. But
we don't know how it works. You get
taught grammar in school, but that's very
far from the actual thing, language. It's
just a very basic approach, usually
having more to do with spelling and
writing, which is not... they're not the
most natural part of natural language.
You could you could argue it's
artificial and, well, for one, you can even
tell that it's different from how we
speak because it's something that
government can change. When
they introduce writing reform, for
example. And how you speak cannot be
changed by institutions. Also, thousands
of years ago, I don't know how long ago,
there were tons of languages without any
scripts. I believe there still are some.
And so they just evolved without any
government, just in anarchy and that's
the more natural part of language. Anyway
why was I getting into this? Oh yeah, we
don't understand how language works. We
just try. We make some language
technology that comes close and is
pretty useful. We use it every day, for
example in search engines.
But we still cannot reproduce exactly what
goes on in our brain. And I kind of like
the mystery. The thing that makes us
different from robots is not knowing how
we really work. But on the other side, I
also enjoy discovering the knowledge
about how we work.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That makes us more self-aware as
well.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, it's a good mirror to hold
up to, again, a self-discovery of "Who am I?"
and how that can be explored, again,
through the robot,
I guess, question that you've just pretty much
raised. Again, we mentioned the matrix last
time. You've mentioned Asimov. There's one
recently called "ex machina".
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Oh a movie, you
mean?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, the film.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Because the book has
been around. I just haven't gotten around
to read it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I didn't realize it's
based on the book. I thought it was just
a film.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Or "deus ex machina".
It's probably a different thing, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, deus ex machina is only a phrase. I
don't know if that is a book they've used to make the film. I
don't know. I just I assume the film was
just... Maybe I'm wrong. I've no idea.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I'll have to look that up.
"Deus ex machina" means "the god out of the
machine".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And "ex machina" then is just
"out of the machine".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So, did
you see it? Was something unexpected
coming out of a machine?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well it's,
the film itself what we're
discussing. The premise is: a young man
wins a competition of software encoding,
goes to a secret place where he wins a
prize to spend a week with the boss of
this big company. And then he has to...
That's what he thinks he's won: it's just
being able to spend a week with him. But
actually he's now
going to do the Turing test, which is
the test: "can a I be classed
as human, here's consciousness?" And
that's the film. The film cogent all that.
And, again, I won't talk any more about that
in terms of what the plot is and stuff.
It's worth watching. It's about the
dude's, the young adult,
his, I guess, discovery.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The Turing test is still around. It's I
mean... Turing has been dead for over 50
years. But wait, Turing lived during
the Second World War, so I'm not sure when
exactly he died. But there was an
anniversary a couple of years ago, maybe
for his birth. Anyway
the Turing test, I believe, has prize
money on it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, wow.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, if you can fool
someone, well, if a machine can fool
someone or, you know, act so well like a
human that you cannot tell them apart.
And that doesn't go into looks it's
basically about language and reasoning.
But we're not there yet.
Yeah, it's exciting to see progress in that
area. But making progress
in technology doesn't mean that we're
making progress in understanding how our
own faculty fully works. Philosophers
have discussed this question for a long
time. They call an entity that comes
really close to being and behaving like
a human in every way, but it's not human...
They call that a zombie.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's the
real philosophical term. It's not slang,
at least not anymore. So a zombie
would pass the Turing test. But the
difference is it does not have the
subjective conscious experience that
humans do. And this is something really
hard to pin down and talk about, even for
philosophers, I believe, because it's
controversial. People have very different
views on consciousness, and free will for
that matter. It ties in closely, I believe.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Are we really alive, in the sense that we...
See, I can't even put it into words.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's
hard, isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Oh, it reminds me of that film
with Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman
where the Machine asks Morgan Freeman... Or
no, first Martin Freeman ask the machine
"can you prove that you're self-aware?" And
the machine says "can you?". It's called
"transcendence". It's great. It
came out about five years ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay. Don't think I've
see that one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's great.
Yeah, Johnny Depp dies, and so he uploads
his consciousness into a computer just
before. He has a wife who's also genius.
And she helps him
stay alive. Because humanity is getting
really critical. And will there be
destruction. And then you have to wait
to find out if that really happens,
you know, or if it can be thwarted, or if it
really is a danger, and so on. It's great.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's really funny because I remember
seeing that come out in terms of like
the trailers and stuff, and be like "I
want to see that" and then being like
"okay, I'll watch it when it comes out
like on DVD or whatever" and then you just
forgot about it completely. I have no
remembrance of it at all, wow.
until you just mentioned it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> If
you're not constantly in touch with
cinema you tend to be...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I tend to be kind
of on the ball with these things because
I love. You know how much I love
any media that tells story. Media,
medium. That tells a story. But do you think
in, personally, do you think that we in
the next... or how long do you think we'll
take, I mean, to be honest I think it'll
happen.
I personally... maybe you're different.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You
mean conscious machines?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>
