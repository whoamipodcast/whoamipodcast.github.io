title: Self Confidence comes from within
epnumber: 34
section: 0
description: Trusting in one's own abilities and believing in one's own value is something that cannot be created or built. Self confidence comes about naturally by resolving inner conflicts and allowing any outer conditions to transpire. Trying to change your circumstances without first working on your inner world is futile and only leads to people living a charade. By becoming conscious of our inner processes we come to find a treasure trove inside of us which then enables us to easily and peacefully interact with the outside world.
