title: A traumatised collective heals through individual awakening
epnumber: 33
section: 0
description: Mental distress in adults can often be traced back to their childhood. The underlying traumatic experience in the past has been suppressed so that every-day life can continue in a more or less normal way. There are indications of a society-wide trauma complex that causes the majority of us to remain subdued and obedient to authoritarianism our entire lives. But it is so subtle and unconscious that we have become blind and acquiescent to ongoing oppression. Who will discover this hidden snare in their psyche and consciously step out of it?
