<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, that's a
perfect segue that will probably be part
of every podcast: the fact that I'll
mention Dune at least once in
everything, which is that the segue is
that that's why a lot of people struggle
with Dune, because it's so different and
so outside of what we understand, or
think we understand, in its environment
in its universe. But once you start
scratching the surface you start to see
the commonalities of the human
experience. That's why a lot of people
read the first few chapters and
just put it down because it's like "What the hell?"
There's so many different words used and
actions.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Dune.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> It's not just names, it's
actually vocabulary.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The political
structure, the vocabulary, yeah.
And again it loops back
into the fact that most stories,
they do have a, the good ones, the great
ones, have the common
human experiences within them.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Even though people have special
abilities it's not too foreign
because, well, we would all like to have
some special abilities. But
you can still use some of your
imagination to see what it's like to
read people's thoughts or fly or
whatever.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Again, it's the emotional
experience, isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, you
call it catharsis, right? I read once
in some, maybe on your homepage,
where you say that catharsis is one of the
reasons you like fantasy media in
general. And that's similar to the gaming
experience we were just talking about:
it's virtual but it's also real.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That loops back to what we said at the start, to do
with (oh man I just went a memory
just lost it)... That's really
annoying. I had it. I had a really good...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay, another question. Maybe you'll
get back to it. As an author of
fantasy, do you have a certain goal
for your readers?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Never. 
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Is there something
rewarding for you if they manage to do
something interesting by reading
your books?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I never really
have the readers in mind. It sounds very
selfish. But it's my experience:
writing the story has always
just been "what would I like to read?"
If ideas come into my brain
I just write them in a way that if
someone else had written the story I
would pick it up and just be absorbed
into it. And I just hope that, you know,
other people enjoy them too kind of
thing. That's always kind of been my... 
Weirdly, in the past I've been a very
overthinking human being. And I still am
in many ways. But when it comes to stuff
like that I just do it. I just write it
out and take the concepts and roll with
them. It sounds really pretentious
and annoying; but the story tends
to kind of just write itself.
I've been very fortunate with that where
they just flow.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Stream of consciousness.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. There's a
lot of editing involved. Don't get me wrong.
There's a lot of corrections need to be
made afterwards. There's a lot of
that, but they solved the initial
outline. I don't necessarily think about
who's going to read this or how they're
going to respond. And again, maybe I should.
Maybe I should be more conscious of that.
There's been stuff that's happened with
certain stories.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I mean, don't let it
ruin your recipe. You know, if something's
working for you.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It feels like it is. It
feels like it is. It's a slow industry, so
current prices are just waiting for a
revamp of all my work pretty much. So,
until that happens I'm pretty much just
working on projects and not really doing
anything in terms of promoting and
marketing.
But the reading
experience and the catharsis, it tends to... I think I try to write them... When
I write, I think a way that
people can interpret it however they
want.
So it's ambiguous and open enough that a
lot of what goes on, you can
pick and choose how you respond to it,
for your own perspective. Often a
story it could be like "Okay, this is how
it is. This is what's going to happen.
This is what's good. This is what's bad.
blah blah". I think a lot of what I write
I think will bite, will polarize people.
People will read it and be like "Okay.
That's cool, blah blah, because they've
seen it as that way". Or other people would be
really offended or be like "This is
rubbish because that's what they've
projected onto it", that they've chosen to
see that side of the story
rather than the whole.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You write
offensive things?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Not offensive in that like the
interpretation... So we talked
about the Frankenstein story earlier. In
the Daria V Frankenstein I deal with
equality and gender roles and those kind
of topics. And again, I'll bit get it now because it's
not time for that discussion. Maybe in the future. But it caused a bit
of difficulty between the editors and
myself, the publisher, to try and get it
to where it needed to be.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Did you have to
push for it, to happen the way you
wanted?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, and I also had to be humble
enough to accept that I was wrong at
various points and make sure that I was
keeping my mind open, again, to how
readers will respond to things; just
because I think that the interpretation
should be one way, or I see an
interpretation that I hope other people
will see. This isn't gonna
necessarily mean they do see it. So I
have to actually learn to be a
bit more specific in the plot and think
about
who's this after being
written for and who's going to read this
and actually you think about that more,
because in the past, as I say, I haven't.
So actually consciously thinking about
it
will make sure there are no obvious
contradictions. Because
if you're trying to do a theme, and then
you end up without realizing it
contradicting it through characters or
through the experiences, then it can
look very bad as a writer and you can look like an
idiot.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And people love to point that out.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, they do.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Maybe you could do something
on social media to get more feedback on
what your readers think about your
stories. I mean, if you want to go that
way. Again, don't do anything to to kill
the thing that works.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> As I
say, this is part of a
discussion, another sort of half an
hour worth of waffling on my part just
to, I guess, discuss that story and what
happened in that story and how in terms
of how it led to me, how many discussions
with the editors about the content, and
if you're trying to cover a certain
theme. So I think that, yeah, for another
time, definitely. How about you? What are
your mediums for social creative outputs? You do
coding and stuff.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. Well I haven't been
creative in a while. But when I do have
some leftover energy I like some
programming. I, let's see, about a year ago
I was trying to gather all the exercises
I did as a student of computer science
and it was difficult to find all the
code left over in Dropbox folders, emails.
And some of the software had moved on, so
that it was no longer compatible.
But then I thought "No. I it's fine for
that to be in the past." I recovered
some of it, and that was interesting. It made
me a bit nostalgic for the days of
studying. I wish I could be a student my
whole life. So no, up till now I
haven't felt the need to produce much. But
now I'm starting a new phase. This is a big
step for me, to do a podcast. So far I've
just been soaking up everything. Some
people like to call me a sponge because
I just love to learn all kinds of things.
And so that's been reading, and also the
last few years YouTube. Since I realized
"Wow, there's a lot more information out
there than what television offers you".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Diverse and more tailored towards
what I think personally is valuable. So
three years ago I developed an
interest in politics, and that was never
there before. So now, I guess you could
say, my output is, or I have a need now
to talk to people about politics.
There's not a lot of opportunity for
that, I mean, with people who are open
even though they have a different
perspectives than I do. Bt whenever I
can, I mention it and and see what
happens, what response I get. For example
on Friday I asked my colleagues "Did any
of you do anything or think about
anything because it was September 11th
two days ago?", and they said "Not really, just that it was on the news a bit."
And I said "Yeah, well, on the alternative
news channels that I watched there was
quite a lot about it, but not in the
sense of let's have a moment of
silence, but let's go through all
the evidence again that shows that the
attacks in in Manhattan were not just a
few people from a cave in in the Middle
East but..."
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There's a lot of
discussion around that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, and
should never stop because it's still
buried and suppressed; and not enough
people know the truth about what
actually happened.
Just how many institutions and
governments were involved in it. Anyway...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well a good idea would be to next
discussion politics and then a bit of my book
stuff, in terms of themes, and how they
relate to, I guess, how as a creator you write, you create things for
yourself and for your audience.
But we can discuss some political
stuff together. We can discuss, you
can if you want to.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Sure. Yeah.
I described the topic, the
main topic of the whole podcast on the
homepage as "we're discussing questions
around personal identity", because that
that's what the question "Who am I?" is
about. Not like "Who the heck am I?!",
but rather, of all the things that people
tell themselves about their identity,
what applies to me? How do I feel
about what I am, who I am, in relation to
the world, other people, the environment.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Temple of Delphi.png"></div>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The Greeks had it good,
with all their philosophy. It
was above the temple at Delphi in, I don't know,
600 BC or whatever, where the phrase "Know thyself" comes from.
This constant desire to know thyself,
to know who we are. Who am I?
The other phrase was "Everything in moderation". Something along those
lines.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Also by the Greeks, you mean?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. So it was at the temple of Delphi. And it
was written above it: those two phrases
"Know thyself". And the translation, I think,
is something on the lines of 
"Everything in moderation" or "Nothing in
excess". That sort of phrase. The "Know thyself" is one of my favorite
things ever. Because all we do
as humans, we just constantly try to understand who we are.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's right, in many different ways: You're the artist. I guess you
express, right? Would you say
you express along your quest for
knowledge about yourself? Yeah, I
like that your goal is not to entertain
people or to make money or to tell
people what they should be. It's
just a thing you do for you.
And if it can help you support
yourself financially, then that's great.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That'll be nice. Again, it's exploring. Like the podcast, the plan of
the podcast is to explore just many
different topics. That's what I do with
my writing. One set of
books is more philosophical and draws on
religion in this fantasy setting. And
then one set is like steampunk mixed
with again the "Who am I" and the equality
concept and the different perspectives
around equality. And another one was just
solely, I think just gonna end up,
being all fantasy and not actually
thinking too much about concepts, and
just literally just be a crazy adventure
story. So again, it's made different ways
of like a podcast or like a story. All are. All are.
It's the same, really. I guess a
shoebox. But that's a discussion for
another time.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I'm not so much the
artist, but pieces of media that have
influenced me a lot, and not made me what
I am, but have resonated with me... I've
also had to deal with the question "Who am
I?". And that's
the
Matrix movies.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes!
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Especially the first one.
I remember how that really got to me.
And science fiction in general.
That's my favorite genre, because it
shows that there is value in in thinking
about questions that we don't ask
ourselves every day. When we go shopping
or working we just live, we just survive.
But I think for life to be more
valuable, you should explore more, deeper.
And that's that's not always easy when
there's no time or energy left for it.
But in movies, since they're
entertaining and a good source of
education as well...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It has to be fun, like
you talked about earlier, where it's
the play thing and we
learn through playing games and stuff. It
has to... People, you know, switch off or
get bored if a
discussion is too in depth or too
detailed. But if you can weave that into
fun things for them, again, everyone has
their own kind of fun. Because my
fun sometimes IS having a massive
theological discussion that lasts hours.
And then other times I just want to play
a board game or D&D which can explore
something else or whatever. I don't know
what's gonna be explored. It is always
trying to be conscious of everyone
else's different fun, I guess. And
meaning of life, that kind of
concept. Because some people do just
want to drift through life. They don't
actually want to explore other things. And
who are we to tell them they
have to? But I think there a
lot of people out there who want to.
That's a key thing as well,
is that they want to discuss these
things but, again, it's not always... They
can't find the right people to discuss
them with.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right. Yeah. We're very
isolated, and we don't realize how much
we have in common. And we're not alone at
all. But it takes some risk
to speak to someone and just open up about things
that can be very private, can be hurtful
to share. But it could be very
rewarding if it works out, so.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The honesty behind it, it's hard. The trust,
trust and honesty. That's what we have. I think that's
pretty much what we have. We have a trust
and an honesty, where we can just discuss
things, life and fun things, and things
that we enjoy.
