epnumber: 45
section: 0
description: Feelings of anxiety often come when some security in our life diminishes. Because we believe that our existence depends on that safety net, we fear that its loss will cause our life to end. Jiddu Krishnamurti has helped many audiences realise the falsehood of such beliefs. In this interview he explains step by step how such thoughts about our existence and its safety are the cause for our anxiety and that the only true security is to be found outside of the realm of thoughts and beliefs.
