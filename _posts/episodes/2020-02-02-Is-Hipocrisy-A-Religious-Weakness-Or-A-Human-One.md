<p><b>William:</b> I also want to
get back to what you said about the
principal and then the action, the
practice. Hypocrisy
is a big thing for people when they hear
or when they're confronted by religion, I
should say. Because often they don't
really seek it out voluntarily. They just
hear someone talk about it or
actually get an invitation by someone to
find out for themselves whether a church
is right for them. And so many
people have made their own experiences
there. They have witnessed or suffered
some rude behavior. Some negative
thing happened to them that
offended them. And this can happen
outside of religion of course, too, very
easily. But I think we have this
expectation for people to just be more
holy and more perfect inside a church
community, so that when a mistake does
happen it feels so much more shocking
and hurtful.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So a lot of
times we have this situation where you
go to church, you're friendly, you're kind,
you're doing all these kind of nice things.
But then you go through your everyday life,
and you're not that same person. You're
like as an individual I guess not
projecting as a as much of a holy or
religious or righteous or, whatever word
you want to use, devout Christian. And I fell into that trap at the age
of like 17, 18, 19, I think, where I
behaved one way in church
situations because that's how I felt I
had to be. Then I felt I could relax
outside of church situations and
didn't have to behave that way as such.
Neither way behaving in
a Christian way on the surface was
anything bad. It was just a bit
more honest, you know. Sometimes I swear.
Oh no! Shock, horror! If you were to swear in front
of any church member,
you'd feel so guilty, or I'm horrific, or
they're gonna think bad of me, or
whatever. And it's a very strange
difference how we respond to
things,
depending on where we are and who we are with.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. It's really unfortunate, I
believe. But I think it's quite normal
for communities that you show or you
focus on a certain side of yourself more.
When I'm on my own at home I'm
more contemplating or analytical than
when I'm out with friends on the weekend,
and I try to bring out my fun side.
So that's just a harmless example
of how we do this regularly. We have dual identities. But it's
really not healthy to have a dual
personality or dual identity if they
stray too far from one
another. So we actually put on nice
clothes when we go to church: suits and
dresses. Some people put in more effort
than others. But that in itself is
something that is tricky. It's supposed
to encourage good behavior or, I don't
know, being more...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's supposed to be
so you don't focus on the clothes.
So if I was just wearing the suit,
jacket, tie, and all the women wearing
dresses, then you're kind of... it's a
uniform. You focus on other things
instead. That's
the mentality I think, is that if I come in
wearing a big T-shirt that has a massive
slogan on it or whatever, then people
notice that more and pay more
attention. I think that's hard the
philosophy. Personally,
I hate it. I don't think it
should be any different, whether you wear
that or you wear a shirt and tie. I get it. I get the philosophy. I get
the ideology of it. But again it's very
much a thing. What is smart and what is not
smart is very much seen as cultural.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There are
cultural norms as well. On the
pacific islands men ware this
skirt whose name I've forgotten. And that
is I suppose a bit formal because
it's very common to wear to church there,
in places like Tonga.
So yeah, this factor of what you
wear can be divisive, kind of like it is
in society in general, how you judge
people quickly by what they wear and how
they present themselves. But another
reason I heard for it is to show respect.
And this is something I personally don't
feel much of. But some people think that
when they put effort into what they wear
and wear these more traditional
fine clothes then they are somehow more
prepared for setting the mood in church
to be respectful of God and the setting
you're in. For some people that is what
they feel. I've asked around a bit, because
I don't like just the assumption being
out there without any substantiation of
it. But for me personally it doesn't
really do anything. I remember even when
I turned 12 there was some pressure put
on me to start wearing a tie. And I
hated it. But I got used to it and I
thought "Okay, I should concentrate my
rebellion on more useful things, or
things that mean more to me
than just a fashion choice." So I just go
along with it to
not make a fuss. But personally I don't
put much stock in it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Either
way it shouldn't matter. This is the
highest part about... Whether you
follow to the letter wear a shirt
and tie and think it's the completely
right thing to do for various reasons
or you think it's the completely wrong thing
to do for various reasons, you're
already focusing on the wrong thing. If you're being try to be a good
Christian or whatever you're already
focusing on like the attire either way...
You know, just wear it, get on with it.
Tat sounds like blind faith. But
actually you've realized it's
more important about the internal: Am I
a good person? Am I kind and loving? It's
almost like if we criticize someone for
going to church wearing
all the smart ties and whatever else
because they feel that's the right thing.
It's already showing that we're almost
being a hypocrite ourselves because
we're just too busy focusing on the
outward appearance ourselves. So we're
doing what they're doing.
We're just mirroring the behavior just from the spectrum. Which again
could be talked about for ages about the
different philosophies or whatever. But if
you just bring it back into what
truly matters and hopefully as a
Christian that should be you know loving
and being kind and happiness.
Because again, this is the
fascinating thing: There's so many the
earliest church has so much philosophy,
so much perspective, so much scripture, so
much debate, so much discussion. And
amongst all that often you we can get
lost in that stuff, I think. All religions
do in general, I think, where we get
these texts, these religious text. And I think
that there again there's so many
positives. One of the struggles is that
the ideology of love and like
compassion and empathy is often drowned
in philosophical debate or just debate
or "What does this mean? What does that
mean?" And it's like "Well, what did you do
today that was you know Christlike? Well,
you know, if Jesus Christ is
your hero in all you're like what you want to
emulate from the New Testament point of
view of going and doing kind things
for others; well how did that go this week?"
You know, discuss that for three hours or
an hour or whatever. Having good philosophical
discussions is important as well.
There's a lot of coverage for that around
and sacred texts and what they teach, but
there should be more of balance in my
opinion. There should be more of a
meeting in the middle. How
those things relate to your ability to
do good in modern society. Because you
know what Abraham or Moses did thousands
of years ago might be important to a
degree. But does it have any sway on what we
do from day to day in our society? Maybe,
maybe not. That's a discussion for another
time. But does it have any point in how to
do good and how to be
kind to one another?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right, another question I
have is about something similar to the
fashion aspect. And that is "How are we
doing on the inside, so emotionally,
mentally?" People want to present
themselves in church like everything is
fine and dandy; and I'm not sure why they
do it.
I guess people in general want to appear
like they're okay because they don't
want to be a burden to others. The
typical opening question "How are you?" is
often answered very automatically "Fine,
good, perfect, excellent", even though it's
not the case. It happens to me all
the time. And then "Wait, no actually no. My
life right now is really upside down."
or "I'm going through a hard time." And
obviously that can be private. You don't
want to disclose that to just anyone. But
I think we could all be a bit more
honest and just, I don't know, just admit
that it's difficult for us to be at
church because we're struggling with
something else in life right now, or "I
can't help you with this right
now because I'm struggling myself".
I think approaches like that are totally
fine and can give you a better
understanding of how people actually are
on the inside. Because it can happen so
quickly to anyone that you believe
everyone is doing perfectly in their
life, because they must be following the
commandments more than you. They must be
more righteous than you. They must be a
better person than you. And that's why
you're the only one suffering. This can
happen in general, on Facebook for
example. People get depressed a lot
because
they only see the great things happening
in other people's lives. Because why
would someone publish about the hard
stuff they're going through? I mean some
people do, and that can be helpful. It can
also cause another type of prejudice
that "Oh, I'm not hanging out with them
if they're just negative all the time."
Well, maybe they're just being honest. And
anyway...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's a good good question, a good discussion point and very
complex as well, as you just kind of just
showed: the fact there's so many
different multiple ways you can respond
to these things.
But I think, so in religion, what you
talked about is a great parallel with
that, and psychology and mental health at
the moment. So again, this is my own personal
views. But you talked about
being honest about an emotional
situation that's difficult, or just even
talked about a little bit about it. You don't need
to open up completely, because it leads
to isolation if you don't. Because you
feel that everyone else is doing fine
and doing well, because that's what you
see, you go "Oh, well I'm doing bad. So I
don't feel I don't feel happy. Or I don't
feel complete. Or I don't feel good
about something, but everyone else is. So
it must be different and weird and alone
or whatever." So into psychology there's
often a teaching about how you can't
say the words "Oh, I understand."
You know, if someone talks about their
situation you can't go
"Oh, I understand", because you can't understand that,
because you're not in their specific
circumstances. And I do completely
understand and get that. But we
experience the
same emotional responses. So you know, as
human beings we all have, you know,
happiness, sadness, pain, love, joy, bliss,
disappointment, jealousy. All these
different things that we have, they are
what connect us. So in a psychological
point of view, actually, when you're
discussing something, if someone
actually shows they
do understand the emotions you're going
through it creates a bond, it creates a
connection I think as human beings we're
lacking in this day and age. It's a lack of
community, a lack of connection
through things like Facebook and
social media projecting false
identities of just happiness and other
positive things. And that happened
at the church scenario of
Christian religion, where you project the
positive happiness. Because that's, you
know... happiness is great. It's good. But
actually, if that's but a lie, if you're
also struggling, you need to be able to
talk about that. You need to be able to
talk about those things and actually cry
about something that you're struggling with,
or talk about it. But you don't feel you
can because the way the community
currently has almost shot itself in the
foot, to use that phrase. You know it's
because they're too busy trying to be
righteous and good, they forgot how to be
human, and how to be honest and open
about their emotions, to create those
connections.</p>
