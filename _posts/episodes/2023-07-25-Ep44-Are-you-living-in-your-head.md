title: Are you Living in your Head?
epnumber: 44
section: 0
description: Everyone overthinks, not only people diagnosed with OCD. We spend the majority of every day ruminating over the same old thoughts&colon; worries about how we are viewed, about our possessions, and about any other thing or idea that makes up our artificial identity. Living in the past is another example of this, for example holding onto regrets or abuses. On the other hand, living in the future is when we imagine a negative scenario that will be unescapable. What is the solution to these counter-productive habits? It is freeing ourselves of the world of thought and time.
