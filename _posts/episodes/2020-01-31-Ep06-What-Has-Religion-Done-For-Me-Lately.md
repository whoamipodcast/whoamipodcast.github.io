<p><b>William:</b> Welcome back, everyone.
We are still Steven and William, and
today we are talking about religion. We
noticed in past episodes that mentions
of God and faith have come up from time
to time, just temporarily. But it's
probably showed you that we have a
Christian background, and we do consider
religion a central part of our lives.
I should be talking more in the
first person rather than for both of us.
But yeah, we'll be a bit more open
about what we believe in this episode,
how it has influenced our lives and our
decision-making, and if there's time we'll
get to religion in general and what we
believe is its value in today's society,
where we live anyway, and maybe in
the West more broadly, and what it could
mean for a person's personal identity in
general.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Religion has a massive
impact on how people define themselves.
So I think it's a good subject for us to
cover, again in general and our own sort of view points and
experiences. So I guess we start off with
that we're both raised in the
Mormon or LDS Church. The abbreviations
a.k.a.
the church Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints. Whether people sometimes call
that Christian or not is up to them.
But we see ourselves, the church sees
itself, as a Christian religion because
it believes in Jesus Christ.
We're both raised from early age in that
religion. I guess it's hard to know
where to begin, I guess, when discussing
how it affects your identity.
