title: The Good and Bad of Making Promises
epnumber: 47
section: 0
description: Humans need each other, and so they need to depend on each other. When we make a promise or sign a contract we intensify an understanding that is usually mutually beneficial, but we also agree to retribution in the case of non-fulfillment. Is such a formal arrangement better than the everyday trust we put in someone's word? Or is it a sign of a lack of trust? Steve and William discuss examples such as business deals and marriages.
