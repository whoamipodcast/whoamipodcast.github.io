title: What Are The Most Valuable Lessons For Our Children?
epnumber: 5
section: 3
description: As a young person enters the new adventure of becoming a parent, they are confronted with challenges they can never be truly prepared for, no matter how much knowledge they acquired beforehand. Making mistakes and learning from them in practise seems to be the only way for us to progress, be it as children or as parents.

<p><b>William:</b> We often think there are these two
worlds: the one where children live
in this blissful ignorance, and then "the
real world" that they need to be prepared
for. And so if we really believe that
there is a difference between
the two, we
must take ourselves so seriously when we
think that we have the experience that
our children are lacking and that we
need to imbue with them with it, maybe
like planting a seed and hoping that
when they are
of age that they will have the toolbox
they need to deal with the world. There are
so many things that can go wrong with
that, so I don't like that view.
That's why I was mentioning it in a
sarcastic way. But we need to think of
their future in some way and try to
prepare them for it. What things do you
think should we concern ourselves with?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Good question.
Where to start with that one? Yeah, that's what parenting is, I guess.
It's like "Where do
you start with preparing your children?"
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. What are the basics? Before the
show we mentioned choosing between right
and wrong to be something that children learn from
parents. And that's automatically. You
don't even need to teach that to them
explicitly. They will just see how you
behave in certain situations, and then
assume that that is what a good person
does. I guess that presupposes that
they accept you as a good person, and you
have a good connection.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I guess the basics of "treat other
like you want to be treated",
compassion, empathy, awareness of your own
needs. It's so easy to swing to one
extreme or the other: always focus
on others or always focus on yourself.
There has to be a fine line when
parenting. Because the prime
example is if a child has someone that
comes over like on a play date or whatever and that child is playing
with their toys, then your child is upset
and therefore wants their toys back. And
then you've got this whole process of trying to teach about sharing.
But then at the same time
has a child learned about possession and
what's actually theirs? And it's okay to
have theirs. They shouldn't always give
away what is theirs. Because then they
themselves will end up having
nothing in their life. Again, these are
things. But it's just a general basic
lesson that gets a bit muddled sometimes.
That's you know a prime example of one
lesson you can try and work on.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I think I'm confused
about that topic myself. Does that say
anything my bringing-up?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Sorry, say that again.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
myself am confused about the topic of
possession and sharing. Does that say
anything about my bringing-up?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I'm
confused too, mate, still. At what
point is it okay to claim
something so that you're happy because it
brings you happiness. And then you give
it to somebody else; and you can get
happiness from that. That can be a
psychological programming, that you
can be generally happy from that and have an
emotionally good response. But again,
deep down do you resent the person for
having that because you want it? And at
what point do you end up being
miserable because you have nothing? And again,
I think the key lesson is
adaptation. I think in any specific
situation the circumstances can be
different. So you're trying to teach your
child that in any given situation they
can find what's optimal for them and
then someone else. That's my personal
opinion. Because you have to protect
yourself; you have to be happy yourself.
You have to generally be looked after.
You have to look after yourself. So that
should come first. Then if you can use
experiences you gained to help others. But in any
specific situation that can change. One time the
best option is to look after
yourself, not go outside and socialize or
something, because you're tired as an
individual. And then another time you may
be tired and exhausted, but actually
someone's health is so bad that you have to
go and help them. Or you feel you have to go and help
them. Or you feel like the thing is to go
help them. And you put your own thing
aside. It all depends on the
specific moment.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I like what
you said about empathy earlier. Because
yes, a lot of questions can be answered
by putting yourself in someone else's
shoes. You know "How would that make you
feel if someone did that to you?" And I
believe most people have that ability.
There are psychopaths who actually can't
do that. And so they have a really hard
time learning how to deal with other
people.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Now that's a dangerous discussion for the future.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah yeah. I don't want to
leave the average person, I don't want to
leave that the norm, what most
people go through. That would be too much
today. But sure, yeah, sociopathy,
psychopathy could be another great topic
for another day. So everyone has the
capacity in that sense for empathy. But we
need to help children become aware of it
and how to use it, how to not overuse it.
You know there are people who 
sacrifice themselves too much for other
people's well-being. That's
challenge as well. So everything in
balance.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Personal experience: I think this is a
key point of this whole discussion, I think,
is the empathy. My personal opinion is that you're right.
Actually
90% of the difficulties between us and other
people can be solved by empathy, by going
"How would I feel if I was them?" And that
can lead to a better situation. But in
terms of going too far with empathy: I, as
a teenager and into my early adulthood,
had too much empathy. I could
imagine what it was like in a lot of
situations that people go through. And it
would leave me crying for days.
I would literally get home from school or
from work, and just that's all I could
do, was just...
Because I've got ten different people I
know, all going through struggles, and then being
able to actually feel what each of
those people could feel, or at least
imagine what they could feel.
That's the difference.
And yeah, I just would be overwhelmed by it,
would not be able to function because
my heart and soul hurt for them. So it's
important to, as you said, to make sure you
don't go to the other extreme.
Because actually,
I'm a personal believer that
too much empathy or love
can be just as bad as too much hate and
selfishness.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It sounds like there might have
been situations where the person you
felt for didn't even have to go through
the pain that you went through when you
imagined what it must have been like for
them. Because they somehow could suppress
it or switch it off.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, they could probably deal better with it than I could.
That's what's
interesting.
And so as a parent, going back to the
point, is that you need to teach
your child about empathy. Definitely,
because it's a beautiful thing
that I think would solve a lot of
problems.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Not everything is
easily transferable. It can be also
really difficult to put yourself in
someone else's shoes. Or when someone
treats you a certain way because they
believe they know what it's like for you,
and actually they don't. So there are other
pitfalls there as well.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Very good point.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And
again, a parent cannot prepare you for
everything like that. So it's something
you need to keep working on for the rest
of your life.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, it really is.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's like a parent can
draw on the experience they got until
they became a parent. And then they try
to help you out in any way they
can
with that experience. But it will never
cover everything and. So you need to make
your own experience, too. And that's when we get to that stage
that we mentioned earlier: how you become
more of friends when you're more on the
same level, and you start to need each
other and you are interdependent, like
you said.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, you have that choice: Do we go on?
You have the agency. But also the
difference between theory and practice.
So your parents have told you everything
about how life works. But unless you go
through it yourself as an individual,
all that theory means
nothing really. And you should be able to apply in a
practical way yourself.
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Sigmund Freud.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> I have
another question about Freud. He said
that our psyche is made up of three
parts. You've probably heard this very
popular theory: the ego, the super-ego and
the it. Yeah? You know those terms? They have different
names. But my understanding is that
super-ego is like a conscience. It tells
you what is right and wrong. And I don't
know if we are born with those or how
much they come from our bringing up, or
upbringing.
I wonder if
you know more on this topic, especially
this thing that I heard that the
father, even more so than the mother, will
be internalized in the child's psyche as
the super-ego of the child. And I wonder
if it's rather the father
because he is usually the one who makes
the rules: "This is how it's going to be."
And then the mother is typically the
more forgiving, merciful part: "Oh,
don't worry about it too much. It'll be
okay next time. But the father is like: "No.
The law is the law." And society is built up
in much the same way, where we have
police and law. But we also have friends
and, you know, it's like a mirror of the
parent situation. And one of the reasons
that Americans vote for someone like
Trump is because they like being told
what is right and what is wrong by a
strong man. You know, this comes from
from that internal psychology about
parenting as well. So it has huge
consequences and is reflected in many
parts of life. But back to my
question: Do you do you think there's any
anything to that that, that a parent
can actually have so much influence on a
child's development that they will give
the child a sense of right and wrong for
many years, maybe their whole life, until
the child finally realizes that the
parent isn't perfect and no, they
didn't know what is right and wrong
properly? A lot of it they decided for
themselves or got from their parents and
just passed it on.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, there's definitely a circular
nature to parenting. It must be from
both the parent and the child. The
parents obviously giving the informationm
doctrine, rules, non-rules, whatever to the
child receiving and wanting just to
please the parent, that it becomes such a
bond, such a connection of "This is what's
right, this is what's wrong", that yes, I think
there is many cases... Again
Every child is different. Some children straight
away, kind of, if they feel their parents
perspectives aren't necessarily right or
whatever they can change them and
adapt. Whereas a lot of, yeah I think the
majority, seem to through those things I just
mentioned repeat what their
parents taught them. It's why we have
situations where families will stay the
same like political view or same
religion. Because those things have been
so ingrained and installed in the
individuals through generation to
generation. So yeah I think there's
definitely a
factor there. I think it's why we don't
evolve as in our mental and emotional
and our broadening of perspectives as much
as we probably should think we should as
a species. Because I think that (1)
the desire to be right and (2) the desire to
make others see that we are right... Therefore that happens into the child, and
over and over again the child has the
same perspective and wants their child
to see that their right as a parent. Why things don't change: I think
if you look a history, it just
constant repeats itself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I like that perspective:
how you look at humanity as a species
over a long time frame. And it'll show
you some positive things, but also some
negative things, like stagnation. Because greed, for example, is contagious
and can take over your life and your
community, your whole way of life. But
then there are always people who are more
interested in being ethical and doing
something that's right for
everyone. And it doesn't mean that anyone
really knows what's right and wrong,
especially for other people. As you
were talking I was thinking of science,
and whether scientific research can help
with this question. There are people who
believe it can. This is in the field of
humanism, for example.
I'm no expert. Maybe you know more on the
topic than I do. But people in this
field want to learn what is
objectively good and right. And some
things are really obvious to us. For
example inflicting unnecessary pain in
someone else.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> How do you
define unnecessary pain? This is
great, because it's a great thing about
science and philosophy
and morality and ethics. Because unnecessary pain, well... I don't know. I could give an answer to your question. But I'll try not to derail us too
much, as I usually do.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, but it's a
good critique. Because a child, for
example, will not always see what is the
use of something that you inflict upon
it; but the parent will.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Vaccination is a prime example.
So in the moment the child thinks. "This is
painful. what are you doing to me? Run
away!" So it thinks it's unnecessary pain.
But we believe that by giving the
vaccination and see the science behind
it, that actually it's beneficial to the
child.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I find it helpful to always think
of the parent as a big child, and that
they would seem just as clueless as a
child to them to someone who has more
experience. So you're never done learning
and evolving. And I guess people who
think just the opposite of humanists and
and certain scientists are religious
people who believe that all right and
wrong has to come from God. And I think
you can go too far in that direction. You
can become irresponsible by just looking
up what the Bible says for every
question. Well, for one, it doesn't cover
every question that we have these days.
But also if God wants us to do right and
wrong he doesn't want to be a dictator.
He doesn't want to have to command us in
every matter, but wants us to learn what
is right and wrong for ourselves.
And we want similar things for our
children. So
there again, it's not quintessential to
do the right thing all the time, but to
learn what is right in a natural way. And
that process in itself, I think, you need
to see the value of that process to be a
good parent.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So I seem to know a
lot of the psychological theory. But
I never know who said it or where it
comes from.
And so, we were discussing
about Freud and super-ego and
the three different things. And I think
that part of parenting
of each other is teaching that we
can change. So a lot of people think they can't
change that impression. So if you've
constantly been taught a certain
way by a parent or whatever, then by
yourself you may overcome it. But it's
not the change that you have to change
it, but that you can change it. So we
teach each other that we can we can change
things, that if we want to, if we
feel it's right or wrong ourselves,
personally, that it can be changed.
Because often it's more of a
dictator thing for everyone. It's like "You must change this. Your parents were
wrong." Or "You mustn't change that."
Well no, the person has
that right, to come to their own conclusions
themselves. So it's teaching that
actually yeah, if they want to they can change.
That option is there. And over time
that will
help them to realise if they want to change
then they can.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's
crazy. It's like big children trying to
be smart enough to tell little children
what to do...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> ...when often the little
children are actually right.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. That's the
amazing thing. I once saw on YouTube how
a father had a son with special needs
physically and mentally. I don't remember
the exact condition. But that's not so
relevant anyway. And he was interviewed
about his life and asked things like
"Does your son hinder you with leading a
fulfilled life? Does he make it
difficult for you to do everyday
stuff, be it working or going shopping
or whatever?" And the father was just... he
wasn't offended, but he was very
surprised at this foreign perspective.
Because he said: "My son is the greatest
blessing I could ever ask for,
in the condition he's in, because there's
so much I can learn from him. And if
it weren't for his condition, then maybe
he would..." I mean, this is very much
paraphrasing. But "...he would probably be so
normal, in a way, that I couldn't have
this unique experience and learn certain
things that you can learn only from
people who are so pure and who have very
different priorities than most other
people." So that was very eye-opening and
humbling to see. Because it's true.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That learning is love, isn't it. You
know learning is: you learn how to love
and be loved
in a very extreme way.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> When people talk
about old people as being a burden, like
a financial burden, because they're no
longer contributing to society in the
sense of creating profit...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, so disgusting.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yes. That's disgusting.
And the least you can say, objecting to
that, is that, and this is also what
what some old people tell themselves to
alleviate their own conscience when they
feel like they're a burden to younger
people: They can say that old and sick
people are there to teach you humility,
to give you the opportunity to
serve, to look after someone else than
just yourself or your company or
whatever. And so, if there is no
other reason then at least that, why
we should have sick and old people or
you know dependent people in our
surrounding.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's almost as if the nature
of existence is designed to teach us one
extreme of how to love or one extreme of
how to be selfish. When you think
about parenting and children and being an
adult and being an elderly person,
everything is designed to either take
you to one extreme or the other, really,
whether it's to look at
what could be positive about the
situation, like that father, where he
was just like "No, he is teaching me
about how to be a better person."
Same with children, same with the
elderly; or like I've talked about
right at the start about how you
could easily fall into the trap of resenting
and hating and being
upset by a situation. And it's
almost like we have to constantly put on
our conscious choices to be able to stay
positive and stay happy and to
learn from these situations and to do
what feels right, what seems
right and make sure that the
happiness the love is what is actually
prioritised.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's a great note to
end on.
</p>
