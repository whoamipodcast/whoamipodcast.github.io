description: William and Steve have been hosting this podcast for nearly 4 years. In that time they have developed mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Their inquiry into who they are has lead them on a path of friendship and a growing awareness. From psychology to spirituality, their discussions have evolved along with them and have been a great medium to express thoughts and inisghts that otherwise might have remained dormant.
