title: I&nbsp;Surrender - Freedom through Acceptance
epnumber: 36
section: 0
description: Apathy is not caring about what goes on with you and around you. Acceptance, on the other hand, is deliberately allowing things within and around you to be the way they are. It is the absence of expectations and intellectual concepts. With this absence the subconscious, and nature in general, can flow freely, heal itself and you can be more passionate about your interests than before.
