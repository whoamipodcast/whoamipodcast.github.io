section: 1
description: As a young person enters the new adventure of becoming a parent, they are confronted with challenges they can never be truly prepared for, no matter how much knowledge they acquired beforehand. Making mistakes and learning from them in practise seems to be the only way for us to progress, be it as children or as parents.

<p><b>William:</b> You
mentioned that you might have a plan of
how you want to raise your children in
the future, but it never goes that way
anyway?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I think that's the
observation I've seen, is that we, in our ideal situation, would raise
children this way or that way. And that's
the moment that when you have
children the opposite will have to take
place, because a child completely is
different to what you think should be
the right thing, because children are all
unique. And until you experience it as a
parent, but any more than 24 hours, I
think once you are at the time of a
child for 24 hours, having to go feeding
them, a bedtime routine and seeing that,
then you can kind of project and get a
bit of insight into how difficult it
actually is. Because I think that as a
society we're getting more and more
insular, it appears. And I think we
are. And therefore help isn't given as
much to families as it should be. Because
you don't have the interaction with
grandparents the way you used to. You
used to be in the community, like if
you're in a village. Everyone would know who you were. You could drop
them off at your neighbors',
your children, as a parent, and then be
able to do what needs to do, come back.
Whereas now trying to get childcare for
families these days, it's a nightmare. And
should we be in a society that allows, I
guess the question is, should we be a society that allows parents,
well at least one parent, male or
female, whatever, to be able to have the
time off to be able to actually raise
children? And personal opinion is yes, it
shouldn't have to be people you're
paying for child care, or asking favours
from friends.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
saw a study recently about "parent time". I
don't know what it's called; the time
you get off work to look after a newborn.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh yeah: maternity leave, and
paternity leave.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I translated
it directly from the German: parent
time. It used to be called "mother
protection". But these days the father
can just as well take that time, or it
can even be split among the mother and
the father. That's an interesting
development. But this this survey, the
study, showed what the law says about how
long the maternity leave is depending on
which country you're in. And there was a
wide variety, a wide variance, which was
really interesting. And I don't remember
a lot of particulars but the Eastern
European countries had a pretty long
time. I think also some of the
Scandinavian ones. I think Germany is
really good with half a year or even
more. And Andrew Yang likes to bring up
in the political
debates for Democratic candidates for
president that the US and Papua New
Guinea are the only two countries in the
world that have no maternity leave.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Wow.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, it's crazy.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's insane.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So definitely that early contact is most
important. But after that contact with
parents and just learning from them 24/7
is not a whole lot less important than
the barrier for a few months. So yeah,
it's a shame that jobs and making money
has to come first, and then you leave
someone else to do the parenting or
parents often expect teachers at school
and nursery...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Especially the single
parents. Obviously with two
parents it's pretty hard in itself. I've
got loads of friends who are single
parents and you know obviously they they
do get help from time to time from
friends or family and from the
government a little bit with money
towards childcare and stuff. But the
equivalent level of help is just
diabolical. It should be so much more
that it actually is: to help someone
who is trying to raise a child by
themselves. Because it's not exactly
their fault.
It's like they're punished because the
other person left or something. It's a big strange.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah. That's a whole issue in itself: "Why are
there more single parents these days
than there used to be?"
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> We can link back, I guess, to our own personal experiences.
Like you said at
the start. I derailed a bit. My
brain switched off. But, our own personal experiences
as children and interacting with our own
parents I guess. Is that alright, if we could
jump back to that?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Of course. Yeah, we see
a lot from how they interact with each
other and with us. We kind of learn a
lot about what society should be like,
what the ideal family should be like. We
like
some things that we experience in the
household. We dislike some things we. We
plan to do things just the opposite from
what we experienced. And some things
we like about our parents.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Often we don't like it at a certain
point in time. And then we grow and
mature, and then we perhaps go "Oh,
hang on a minute; that probably was the
right thing for us, again hindsight as a
growing consciousness individual person."
You kind of go "Okay, yeah, fair enough; I
see why that was that way now." But at the
time, especially you know you go through
those teenage years that you remember.
Because I remember certain things as a kid,
little things that I
maybe wasn't happy with. But then later
on, again as a teenager, you're going through
loads of stuff and therefore remember
those more prevalently... That's wrong
word... strongly.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> My father has this saying about the
perspective of a teenage boy, how his
father used to be really stupid. And then
when the boy turned 20 or so his father
suddenly became a lot smarter in a very
short time.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Sometimes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And then, I
hear, when you have your own first child,
as a young woman, you have
your own first child, your mom
becomes your best friend all of a sudden.
Because you're on the phone all the time
asking for advice.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Big change all of
a sudden.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> When big
changes happen happen we often
default to wanting that parental
safety net I guess. So people that have
semi-good
relationships or even good relationships
with their parents will often, when
they're older, you know, at twenty
years plus, if they need help
default. And that's the person they know
they can rely on the most or they feel
they can rely on the most,
if they have a good relationship with
their parents. Whereas people that don't
have their parents
around anymore will have a bad
relationship...
they often yearn for that parental
safety net, just like "I wish I could
speak to my mom, or I wish I could speak to
my dad, or whatever." It's often in
times of crisis and trauma that tends to
be the go-to. Which is interesting, the concept whether that's
genetic, or whether that's
social-cultural. It'll be interesting to those kinds of things. Often it's a bit of both.
But I
guess there is just something about the
family unit sometimes that you feel you
can rely on more if it's a tight-knit
one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And if you don't have a parent
to rely on, or that you grew up with and
had a good relationship with, then it's
really important for you to have another
father figure or mother figure to rely on.
in times of uncertainty.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. To link it back to when I was a kid, obviously:
My parents
went through a divorce. I
was probably six or seven, I think is. And I
often looked for other male figures to
latch onto.
I still adapt, because it wasn't as much as I would have liked, I guess.
I therefore, when
I was at social events with friends and
family and stuff, there'd be
an uncle or parent's friend or whatever that
I would just spend more time with than
before that I guess male figure to be in
my life.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's important.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think we get to pick and choose. As
we get older... I still
always rely on my parents loads. But even
for my teens I found many maternal and
paternal figures to be like a parent,
like a mum or a dad, not the mom or
dad. Again it's important for me to
separate those things because my parents
have been amazing: my mom, my stepdad
and my dad have been incredible. But
during those times, especially as a
teenager, you're not necessarily going to trust
your parents.
You think they're ignorant and stupid,
And often they did, but I wasn't one to listen,
so would find someone else that could
fill that space, that had the
knowledge I guess I was looking for, or
the kindness maybe, or time. I don't know. I guess it was more
about me.
My parents
were willing to listen and willing to help.
But I as a teenager wouldn't give them
that chance and would find other people to
do that and saw them as
mothers and fathers in a way.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I heard
that and in the beginning as a child
you're dependent, then as a teenager you're
counter-dependent, which is kind of a
necessary step to the next step,
which is independence. So counter-dependent, we
also call it rebellious sometimes.
But it's necessary to try out things I
guess and see what works best. And then
independence is also not sustainable. You
do need help,
food, shelter, all the basics, and you
cannot... usually people cannot get all
of those for themselves. And so after a while you
learn interdependence. That's at the
top that you want to get to: the best place,
where you realize you need people, and
they need you; everyone has their value,
has their contribution. At least
that's what everyone's process should
look like.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's a good way of describing it. I like it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But I found that as a
teenager you might have this unrealistic
view of your parents about how stupid
they are. And then when you do
become more independent you realize more
and more, or I should say I, I realize
more and more how my parents do have
weaknesses and limitations. They used to
be invulnerable and just godlike to me. I
don't know how to say it, just entirely
dependable, who always know what to do,
wise, you know. And now I see, well not now
but for the last years, I have seen more
and more their weaknesses. It's good of them
to not try to hide them and be honest
about them. It was just
something I had to get used to and learn
to deal with: you know that I cannot rely
on them for everything. They always want
to help me, just the same as they always
have.
But now I realize they cannot always
help me. And so sometimes I will need to
look elsewhere for help. But never, I
never really
want to lose contact with them just
because the dynamic and the roles have
changed a bit. I even told my mom
once that I see us more as friends now,
rather than dependent and caretaker.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That is the goal:
being able to be friends.
I liked you
talking about the dependence, counter-dependence that links very much with the
you start off by thinking they're infallible. And they can't make a
mistake. And then you think this like
ignorant and you lose that
perspective. That seems to link in with the counter-dependence. And then when you become
independent you probably don't even
think about it; you try go and do your
own thing. And then when you become
interdependent you realize that they
actually have their strengths and
weaknesses. And then you can help them,
and they can help you, and you can become
friends. Because like my mum is one of my best
friends, without question. I
can talk to her about anything. That was
never the case until about 22, 23 maybe.
Before that I was like "Okay, I love her." You
know she's mom. We would talk about stuff. But
I did'nt
give her the trust she deserved maybe
for whatever reasons. And then once I grew up and realized that
actually that it's optimal to both be
there for each other. Because you know
so many times that I'm there for my mom.
And that's what friendship should
be: it should be a two-way thing. I think
a lot of people think the parent thing
and child things should just be all the
adults there all the time for the child.
But again the inter-dependence is amazing, where it's
she helps me out loads, and
then she knows she can come to me and talk
to me about stuff if she needs to, and
does. I'm very lucky to have that in my life.
