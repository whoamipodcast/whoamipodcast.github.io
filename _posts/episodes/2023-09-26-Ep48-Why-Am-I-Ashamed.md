epnumber: 48
section: 0
description: What secrets do you have? What facts about you must never become known to others? What happens in our childhood that implants beliefs in us that hide away for the rest of our life? Can we uncover them deliberately? Can we regain the emotional freedom and levity that playing children have? Steven and William discuss theses questions in an attempt to better understand where shame comes from and how to heal from it.
