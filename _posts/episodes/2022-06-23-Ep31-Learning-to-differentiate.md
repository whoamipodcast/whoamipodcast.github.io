epnumber: 31
section: 0
description: We have thousands of thoughts and feelings each and every day. How many of them are we aware of? How many of them remain subconscious and unnoticed? Are you content with the thought patterns installed in your subconscious and the resulting emotions? Do they work in your favour and motivate your to take productive actions and experience pleasant sensations? Or do you feel like the victim of your own brain without the necessary control to freely make your own decisions? Learning to identify and distinguish these inner workings is an important step to this end.
