title: You shouldn't should - The toxicity of expectations and absolutes
epnumber: 32
section: 0
description: How much of your behaviour comes from your freely made decisions? And how much of your every-day life is run by subconscious programs? From day one we are influenced by the actions and inactions of people around us. They inadvertently, and sometimes deliberately, shape our perspective and thereby our reasoning and decision-making. Can we rise to a level of consciousness that allows us to view these subliminal messages from the outside without being invested in them? Or are we doomed to repeat the cycle and unwittingly pass them on to the next generation?
