title: Choose your own Purpose in Life
epnumber: 30
section: 0
description: Are you free to create your own path in life? Or are you following a script? Everyone is in both situations to one degree or another. The more we choose to drop beliefs about who we SHOULD be and what we SHOULD be doing with our time and energy, though, the more we are free to choose our own values, goals and methods of achieving them. This process is one way of filling our life and those of others with purpose and meaning.
