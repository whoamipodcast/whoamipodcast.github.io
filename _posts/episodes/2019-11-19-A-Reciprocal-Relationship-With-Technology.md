<p><b>William:</b> 
How do we change when
technology changes; and I think we should.
But
then, if we change in a bad way, should we
really progress in technology?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
I
guess how do we define bad, I guess
by putting more by
our own personal opinions, more selfish,
more anti-kindness, I guess.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Well one
simple way is "how much are you hurting
people?",
for example "how much are you killing people?"
And that's ok that's not always simple
to calculate. When you shoot someone
then the chain of causality is really
short and you can tell "because this
person did this, this person got hurt or
even died". But if it's a lot more subtle
and taken on like huge timeline and
over huge masses of people, then the
causality is really difficult to find.
But I believe Gandhi once said "Whether
you shoot someone or starve them to
death over a period of years, it's the
same to me." It's the same kind of
violence.</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Mahatma Gandhi.jpg"></div>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
I think that's how I look at it
as well.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Suffering is something I
think a lot of people can agree on no
matter what their religious or
philosophical background is.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
It's a good
way to finding it, definitely. Yes,
suffering.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
So removing suffering is, in my
view, progress. That's a pretty universal
one. But just making life easier isn't
always as valuable. Obviously
we are supposed to go through
hard times, and we're supposed to grow in
certain ways. </p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
That's how the species
evolves.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
If all of that is gone, what
is the purpose of life, if it's not to
develop and grow and change over time?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Well this week's random Dune reference
is, I'm gonna put in here now, is that in
the 4th Dune book it talks a lot about
the predator and the prey, and how
both species are progressed by
each other. So the predator, you know,
hunts the species that's being
hunted. The prey adapts over time, evolves,
finds a way to counter the predator.
The predator then has to evolve and find a
way to counter the prey's innovation
of it. And it's a constant cycle of progressing and changing, and
again, who knows into what. Because that's
the constant variables that get changed.
And I think we forget that a lot. We seem to remember that physical
hardship makes us stronger. So going
the gym, you know, you've got to lift weights.
That's gonna make you stronger. But we
forget that often it's the I guess
psychological and the emotional hard
times that give us things like willpower
and perspective, 
choice. Because often if we don't
make the choice we become bitter
when bad things happen to us. We over
time can easily become angry and
bitter. And therefore we need to
understand that we have a choice here. We can try and slowly over time not be
controlled by that natural reaction. And
I guess "How does technology help us do
that?" I guess is a good question.
That's been a massive thing for
that, because it's the connection between
people, if you try to connect to people. It
also isolates as well.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, it can. It seems like no
matter what stage we're at
technologically, we always need to learn
the same set of principles like about
"What is right and wrong?",  "Who am I?",
"How do I want other people to treat me?"
and "How should I treat them?".</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
What's my
place in the universe?", you know, "How does
my existence mean anything?".
Questions
like that, as you say, no matter
where you are on the technological scale,
those questions are always going to be
there.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
You know how grandparents live
like they stopped progressing with the
technology, and they they still use
technology from before, at least a lot of
them. I get it. I don't think
that's wrong.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Change is difficult.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, and so when you tell them about the
challenges of your life, you know, growing
up with the current technology, they'll
say "Oh, it sounds so complicated. Times used
to be so much simpler before." But
everyone went through similar challenges,
even if it manifests in a different way.
Your character is tested. You bond with
people. You sacrifice. You grow. You
learn things. You find out more about who
you are.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
It's all just so much more
extreme now and in such a faster pace.
I do not envy teenagers
and children of today. They are
bombarded with the technology and
the interaction of the selfish side of
people. So the businesses the media the
politics around a lot of things, where
they are constantly being advertised to,
told "this is right, this is wrong", the level
of confusion they go through at an early
age. Again, it's good, it's important to
get these question, to ask these questions and
to learn what your sort of, I guess, moral or
intellectual,
cultural, integrity is. But you
shouldn't have to do that like at 9
years old when you're being bombarded by
advertisements about buying this, but
you're getting your heartstrings
plucked by advertisements that tells
you how poor everyone is in this place,
and you should be making these choices
by buying this product. And it's just
like, and that happens all the time.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah,
that's a good point. I saw on the news
some children maybe 12 or 14 at climate
change protests just losing it
because they can't handle the fatalistic
perspective. And I think everyone needs
to work on that if they, you know, a lot
of people will just suppress the idea of
of climate catastrophe. That's how a lot
of people deal with it. But some want to
expose themselves to these terrible
thoughts of where we're headed. And it
can overwhelm them. I also need to
find a balance between those two sides:
how much will I open up to thinking
about it, and how much am I not ready for
it?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, and how much we can do?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Or
another thought I had when you were
talking was: how
early does information overload already
happen? Nowadays, like it used to be the
way, one generation ago I think, where
some young people were exposed to
pornography and a lot of them weren't. So
was the question whether you had to deal
with that early on. And nowadays it's
just when, when does it happen? I
don't know the statistic, but I read that
on average nowadays boys at the age of
eleven are confronted with the topic. How
do I deal with this? What am I feeling?
What's going on? I don't know what to do.
So yeah, it shouldn't have to be that
early, that youg.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yes, certain education should
be slow, gentle and specific to
the individual. It's just like
if a group is bombarded with one thing
they will react differently,
they'll behave differently. They're all
going to respond differently, but they don't have a
choice. They no longer have a choice to
just do it at their own pace. On the
playground and in the classrooms and
after school and stuff they, if they aren't
understanding it at the same pace as
other people they are bullied for it. And
that's potentially a
downside to information overload. And
because we have so much technology
it's just everyone's exposed to it all
the time. And we're taught, you know,
parents regulate it, and help with whatever else.
But there needs to be a bigger social
push, probably, maybe, in my opinion, for help
with that. Because it's not as easy, because 
if your parents regulate it, cool that's
fine.
You'd be seen as an outsider at school
because you don't know what else is
going on. And then you get exposed to it by
your friends. And then it'll maybe be out
of context, or certain things will be
out of context. Who knows?
But it just feels like there's no
support. You're just told as a parent, "Okay, if you don't want your kids exposed to it,
just regulate it. It's your 
decision." But there should be more
guidance maybe to make others realize
that we should have a social conscience
about other people's exposure to it. More
sensitivity maybe, more sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Topics like this make me wonder if we're
going to divide and cluster more in
the future so that the only way to
protect yourself and your children from
certain ideas or people, from influences,
from information, will just be to
distance yourself from them. And that maybe like new collections or a society,
yeah societies of people, will form
around shared values rather than
nationality.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
That is an interesting thought. I think
it would probably implode first. And then
evolve into that maybe. I don't know
how gradual that process potentially would be maybe.
You'd have to isolate yourself and
find others that want to do it, too. Then
go back to money: you'd have to have
enough money to sustain your system. And then
it's a shame that you'd have to narrow
yourself away from other perspectives.
But if it is a protection thing so that
you're not creating a, let's say, a society
that has so much anxiety or fear, then
maybe running a little bit away from it,
avoiding it is better than being so
exposed to it all the time.
Yeah I think
I think maybe ... I'm going to think more
about it. But what you've said about
cultures dividing into little communities,
countries dividing into communities, where you
stick to people that have the same sort of
perspective on technology, I think,
is probably what we're talking about. Is
that right?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Or ethics of
technology.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Or ethics just in
general.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yes in general is what I meant.
But I'm open to linking it back to
technology. So yeah, there are
communities like this already, like
kibbutz. They live a lot less capitalistic.
They are more socialist. They take care
of each other.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Have you seen the
village, the film "the village"?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
No.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Okay.
Maybe I mentioned this before. I can't
remember. But it's ... the
guy that plays the Joker at the moment. How do
you pronounce his name?
"Joaquin Phoenix"? And they've gone back to a
sort of 1800 sort of lifestyle.</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Joaquin Phoenix.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Like the
amish?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, basically. They live in a
village. And the film is about
them in their own community and
what happens to it, just how it appears
to be a sort of paradise, and then social
things still come into play, and there's
sort of a breakdown.
Kind of. It's more compicated than that, and
more simple at the same time. But I don't
want to give anything away.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
All right. I
just thought of another movie as well on
the topic: Keanu Reeves is this alien and
he's not the only protagonist. You
also follow this young mother and her
child.
And so he's impressed by the love that
she has for the child, you know, how she
is willing to sacrifice her own life for
the child to live on. So that's one
thing that is a big plus for
humanity. Because he he just comes with
this prejudice that humanity has
just
been terrible for the planet, so it has
to die out so that the planet has a
chance of healing, which is very
understandable.
I see where the premise comes from. But
the lady tries to protect humanity,
basically, with everything she can
think of. And she's very smart.
She goes and takes them to her dad. Or
they end up there for some reason. And
the dad is an intellectual. And he says
"We've been at a point like this in our
history several times, and people are
lazy or, you know, they they will not do
something until it's absolutely
necessary. But when they're at the
precipice, when they are looking
destruction, annihilation in the face
they will suddenly change,
even if it's a drastic change. And that's
what it had to come to in the movie as
well for people to start over.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
That's
always been myself an
argument, I guess. When people start to
get despairing going "Oh humanity is so bad
these days blah blah blah." I'm like "No. Look
at every crisis. Every
crisis that happens when a natural
disaster, war, that is caused by a
minority of selfish people. But the
general humanity, they will help each
other. They will look out for each other.
They will die for each other to make
it work, to survive. And I
always fall back on that. That's
what happens. Again, there's pockets of
people who'll take advantage, whatever
else. But actually, yeah, the majority of
people just bound together. But it
has to be the extreme for some reason.
For some reason at extreme.</p>

<div class="insertable" id="Yanis Varoufakis.jpg"></div>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Suddenly
we realize that "Oh, we actually have a
lot in common like we want to survive,
for example. So we have that common enemy
and we need to stick together to
overpower it." And then suddenly we focus
on the common values we have.
One other movie I want to
mention or I should say series is "Star
Trek", especially the next generation. There's this Greek philosopher, no sorry,
Greek politician, Yannis Varoufakis, who
was the Minister of Finance in Greece
for a short while until he saw how
corrupt government is and how he can't
really make any change for the better as
a minister. And so he said he left
government to enter politics. He
says whenever he's asked "So what kind of
society do you are you working for? What
would you like to see? Is it more socialist? Is it more capitalist?"
And he said "No, no. Forget that paradigm."
And then he shows clips on his phone
from YouTube that he bookmarked about
the next generation, and especially this
one episode where... Have you seen the
next generation?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
I can't remember
many of the episodes.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Obviously there are hundreds of episodes.
Let's see if you know this one I
think three people were asleep in
cryogenic sleep for several centuries.
They come from our time, and the next
generation plays I don't know in the
24th century or so, where people live in
abundance. There is no longer a need for
food rationing.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
There's no currency.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Right, and what is the purpose
of their life? It's to expand your
horizon, right? That's why we follow
the adventures of the explorative navy
going out into space, making contact with
new life-forms and stuff like that. And
in the process getting to know
themselves better. So I love this this
idea. And he says we need to work
towards getting there. So
one of the guys that comes from our time, 
he is rich and he loves the challenge of
just being better than the next guy. And
when he looks around how they live on
the enterprise (I get them
mixed up) he says, "So what do you do with
your life? If it's not the
challenge to get more money, to do
better, to always be better than someone
else?" And it's, "Improve yourself! Stop
comparing yourself to other people. You
have value by yourself. You just try to
improve other people's lives when you
have enough for yourself. And just
learn. Develop! You can never
have enough of that.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
It's difficult, though,
because we're so used to a tangible
thing. So if I have a million pounds
I have a quantifiable thing. And it
may be more than someone else. Therefore
"Woohoo, go me! I'm doing well." The
problem is that we're so used to
measuring things that we think that asking
yourself,
or being self-aware, be more conscious
of other people, there's no way really to
measure that.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Right, you
cannot assign numbers to the more
valuable things, like "I love you five."</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah. Good reference.
Yeah, and in my personal opinion we need to move away
from that obsession with putting a value
on things. Things just are. I use this a
lot recently with people when I talk
about right and wrong, good and bad,
positive negative. We use these things to
quantify stuff. But so often they just
are. We don't need to assign a
label. They still exist without that label.
And it becomes more harmonious without
that label, going back to the whole you
know money, or as you say "I love you five",
"I love you ten". It suddenly
becomes a competition again. And that's
where it falls short. That's where it
becomes... it's no longer what it should be.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, just a comparison. We should
definitely have an episode on this.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
There are a few branches, a few topics
we've kind of touched on that we could have an
episode or two about. But I guess to
kind of be heading towards a
conclusion, I guess, of this episode... I've really enjoyed the you know AI
explanation just for my own sake, really.
And I think a good balance between
discussion, between technology and
ethical things, like social things, I
really enjoy the contrast between them.
Because
we could just talk about the
technology side of things. And then in another episode we could just
talk about the cultural
things. But actually, you know, we have
discussed them both intertwined. And I've liked that a lot.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Good. Yeah, I hope we could get some thoughts going in
our audience's mind. I think
that's one of the main purposes of the
podcast, is just to get you thinking
about some interesting questions. We
don't pretend to know the answers. We are
just interested in making people more
aware.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah. That was a good episode. And
hopefully, any questions you have: we have
Facebook, Twitter, we have social media</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, just go on the homepage: https://whoamipodcast.com</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Join the
discussion.
And the next time we'll figure out a
topic and go from there.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
All right. Thanks
for listening.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Bye.</p>
