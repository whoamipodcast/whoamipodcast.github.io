<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Often we think too big in life. We think
somehow we must make a massive political
or social, cultural change, whatever, as
you say. But just one step at a time in
your own little circle of yourself and
then your circle friends, and those you
associated with.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I think that that's
the ideal way for humanity to make
progress. I don't like this hierarchical
view that so many of us have
that there's always one at the top who
is the leader and makes decisions for
everyone else. Obviously some people need
guidance. They need to mature before they
develop the self-discipline.
And that happens through example,
sometimes through force. But, I don't know. It's a bit like parenting.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah. 
Education tends to be that medium these
days, because parenting doesn't really happen
much anymore. It's you get parented, you
get taught at school, whereas you just
get taught at home as well. Whereas now you
come home, you go out with your friends,
you go to where you want, really.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Many
homes don't have two parents.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Or three, or
four. Just, weirdly, this is a completely
different side topic here I thought about
this week: about the family structure and
how, it was grating my brain, we
have such a rigid parental structure.
Because you're only being influenced by
two people, and both those people have
their own kind of, probably, likely have
similar perspectives to a degree because
that's where they got together and got
married. And then you're locked into a
parental unit that is very one-sided.
And I'm like "why haven't we, as a
culture, evolved or progressed where, you
know, you have, I don't know,
five parental figures, like male and
female figures within a
social structure to allow for a massive
amount of progress in both parts. Like
the parents themselves would have to
deal with each other. So therefore they
would benefit from that side of ... not conflict, that's the wrong word,
but just like different perspectives. And
the child would get loads of
them. And they would all harmonize and
just be like "this is a list of
perspectives.
No one's right or wrong. It's just
different ways of thinking." But yes, this is just
idealistic, stupid unicorn-type mentality. But just the last
week or two I was just thinking about
that: "Yeah, it's so narrow. The
structure we have."</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Well, I enjoy your
questioning processes. Are just the
way they've always been? Do they really
need to be that way?
My first answer to this particular
question was going to be "Well they are
the biological parents." But when you
adopt a child you can, from what I hear,
you can love them just as much as
biological parents.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yes, love
isn't a biological thing, is it?</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I don't
know.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Okay.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I don't know. Is there a
bond between a parent and a child?
Also think of other species like fish or
something. Do they feel a connection? Or
is it always ...?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
We assume we are the only beings that,
at least in this world, are capable of a
higher level of love, or whatever.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
I suppose so, yeah. I never thought about it that way.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Because you have a physical attachment, which is your
chemistry, which we sometimes call love.
But actually that tends to be
more ... not lust, that's the wrong word,
but a physical connection-type
thing. But
love itself actually often overrides the
physical. Because physical things like
jealousy can come into your brain,
for survival reasons, evolutionary reasons. 
Obsession, we we often mistake
love for obsession, and then actually if
you do love someone you're able to
override that obsession because you see
the bigger picture. When it comes to
children, linking it back, I think you can
very much as an individual have a
capacity to love beyond what is physical.
Just my random thoughts.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
It makes sense, what you're saying. I have heard
about the biological imperative: that we
all have this drive in us to keep our
genetic material alive.
I've actually met people who said
explicitly that for them the purpose of
life is to keep their genes going. So
even when they as an individual die,
they are happy knowing that, I guess, at
least half of their material, that
mixed with with that of their partner,
lives on in their children. So
there is that. I've never felt the need
to keep my DNA or whatever alive. I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Well it's just that the first people
you've spoken to have said it
consciously. Because for most people is just
a subconscious thing. It's just like a
genetic thing. It's an
evolutionary thing to keep the species
alive. They just have that drive to make
sure.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, and we will kill other species to make sure that ours survives.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Quite fascinating. Just a side tangent.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
No, it's interesting.
It's part of the overall topic of
personal identity, like being a child in
a family with two parents, or is
something else possible?</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Because having one
parent can be just as beneficial as
having 20 parents, let's say, or two
parents, or even more so. It all depends I
guess on individual circumstance. And I
guess ...
that's my own little conclusion from my
little tangent right now.
Ultimately I don't think it
matters, because as long as you're
getting what is classed as good and
loving upbringing, it shouldn't matter
whether it's one, two, twelve, whatever.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
Yeah, in some culture the larger
family has more importance, like children
will have more contact with their
grandparents, and they will all live in
one big house.
I've even seen that in Germany, you know,
with single families, not the whole
settlement or something. But there
are certain cultures that have a
slightly different view. But yeah, the
two-parent thing is a predominant one, as
far as I know. I heard that
communism had a slightly different view
on this as well: that the ties, the
biological ties didn't matter as much, I
don't know, there were some very liberal family
conditions, I guess, or just living
conditions where several families live
together and all the adults raised
all the children, no matter who was whose
progenitor. And maybe I'm connecting
this with communism because everyone
just belonged to the state. Anyway, everyone
was on one level, and it's like your
children didn't even belong to you. I
mean, you have the same connection to them
as to everyone else, because everyone was
equal under the state. Yeah, we
should get into that more in a separate
episode.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
I think you're right.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
When I feel
better prepared.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Yeah, my bad. just
having some random thoughts come into my head.</p>

<p><b>William:</b> 
You have a link back? Okay.</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> 
Well no. I was
gonna say, well linking it back:
We were talking about regulation of the
machines and, I guess, a weird link / segue is
that regulating machines and
regulating humans, that's the same.
