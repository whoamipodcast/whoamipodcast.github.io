title: Love is Love - Diversity in Sexuality
epnumber: 26
section: 0
description: How much contact have you had with the LGBTQ+ community? William and Steve talk about their experiences and compare their views. It is important to become educated on this topic so as to avoid and confront marginalisation and persecution. Humanity is slowly opening up to integrating world views that make room for non-heterosexual persons. But there is still plenty of room for improvement and learning how such aspects of sexuality make up our individual and societal identity.
