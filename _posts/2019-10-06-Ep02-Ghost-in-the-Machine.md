<p><b>Steven:</b> Hello, welcome to the podcast "Who am I".
I'm Steven.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And I'm William
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And this is episode 2. Welcome.
Last podcast was
really fun and we had a good time,
just chatting away. You've been working hard
on all the editing and stuff, so that's
much appreciated.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that was an interesting process. I
got to learn about video editing,
uploading, publishing. And pretty soon I
will have the transcript ready to put on
the webpage. And then hopefully our pages
will become more searchable that way.
Also, I really want us to make a trailer.
I'm going to collect some material for
that. It could just be cutouts from the
show.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Maybe funny moments, maybe
dropping my phone could be part of it.
It must be good for something, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Organizing a podcast from
scratch and what big things could go
wrong.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Exactly, yeah. But there's no time
pressure. It just takes however long it
takes. But it'll become a
routine and go quicker. So I look forward
to that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes.
</p>

<h2 id="robots-and-zombies">Robots and Zombies</h2>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay, today my suggestion for a
topic of discussion is self-awareness.
For example, you can look at it from the
perspective of artificial intelligence
or robotics, if you will. How are humans
different from robots? I really love
reading Isaac Asimov.
He's my favorite author, and he is known
for writing lots and lots about robots.
He is, in my mind,
similar to Tolkien. Whereas Tolkien built
this whole planet, continent, you know,
with
lots of different creatures, languages,
scripts, fauna, flora, Asimov created a
galaxy in the future. And it's so far in
the future that Earth has become a myth.
This one planet where human life
started. And in some of the stories
people try to find out where it was by
looking into really old texts. But anyway,
that's a tangent.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You go ahead. Because, again, I
haven't read as much Asimov as I
would like. So hearing what it's about
actually from you, it'll be
educational for me and I'm sure for the
readers as well.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Which books or
movies are you familiar with?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So I have... this is going to be difficultbe cause my memories are so bad.
The most famous one, I
haven't read much of that one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The foundation series.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, foundation series.
I jumped into one at first to try...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Empire series, robot series.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It might
have been the robot series.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Ok, yeah, that's probably the most known one.
Or
next to Empire, next to foundation at
least.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I heard of it being really good.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There's lots of short stories in one
compilation, and the movies come from
that series: I Robot and the Bicentennial
man. Yeah, and so in those movies and many
of his books he deals, or the the main
person, deals with questions like "is this
a robot?". Similar to that film with
Harrison Ford.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Bladerunner.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, where he thinks
he has the test to know whether someone
is human or a robot. And you find out
just how tricky that can be. And so this
is a popular topic in sci-fi, one of
the reasons I love sci-fi.
And it's not just a computer science
question, but also a philosophy question.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. It's a humanity question?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Humanity?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, humanity question.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's interesting that humans
want create machines in their own image,
first of all. Why do machines have to be
humanoid? Our shape is really useful
for lots of things, but not all things.
And so there are machines in other
shapes as well, obviously. But it's
interesting how much we want machines to
be like ourselves. And so in some of
these stories by Asimov he allows, or
he writes without his machines his
robots become so much like humans that
the question gets more and more difficult: what's
the difference? In one of them a
robot man falls in love with a human
woman and tries to become more and more
human, a bit like data in Star Trek,
except that he really succeeds. His maker
is really helpful, keeps updating his
biology, I want to say, his anatomy. There
you go. And in the end there is no
more significant difference. I won't
spoil the end: what was the very last thing that
he that he needed to change to become
human? But the Bicentennial man was
granted human status: a civilian of
humanity, or a citizen of humanity. And so
but that's really interesting. What does
it take? And since they're fiction I
don't know how close they are to reality.
But we are certainly going in a similar
direction of making machines more and
more similar to humans.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It seems to be
the peak goal: okay we can make
computers, we can make machines. But the
goal by science and computing and all
that seems to be to make a machine that
can be a human, that can be classed as
human in nature, human in being, human
in looks.
It would be interesting to know why
exactly that actually is, why we so
strongly desire a lot of...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> A lot of
scientific research is not just about
analyzing and understanding aspects of
nature, but then also recreating it
and simulating it. And then you compare
it with nature and see how close you can
get. So I am in natural language
processing, for example. And there we try
to understand language which you could
say is nature. We use it every day. But
we don't know how it works. You get
taught grammar in school, but that's very
far from the actual thing, language. It's
just a very basic approach, usually
having more to do with spelling and
writing, which is not... they're not the
most natural part of natural language.
You could you could argue it's
artificial and, well, for one, you can even
tell that it's different from how we
speak because it's something that
government can change. When
they introduce writing reform, for
example. And how you speak cannot be
changed by institutions. Also, thousands
of years ago, I don't know how long ago,
there were tons of languages without any
scripts. I believe there still are some.
And so they just evolved without any
government, just in anarchy and that's
the more natural part of language. Anyway
why was I getting into this? Oh yeah, we
don't understand how language works. We
just try. We make some language
technology that comes close and is
pretty useful. We use it every day, for
example in search engines.
But we still cannot reproduce exactly what
goes on in our brain. And I kind of like
the mystery. The thing that makes us
different from robots is not knowing how
we really work. But on the other side, I
also enjoy discovering the knowledge
about how we work.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That makes us more self-aware as
well.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, it's a good mirror to hold
up to, again, a self-discovery of "Who am I?"
and how that can be explored, again,
through the robot,
I guess, question that you've just pretty much
raised. Again, we mentioned the matrix last
time. You've mentioned Asimov. There's one
recently called "ex machina".
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Oh a movie, you
mean?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, the film.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Because the book has
been around. I just haven't gotten around
to read it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I didn't realize it's
based on the book. I thought it was just
a film.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Or "deus ex machina".
It's probably a different thing, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, deus ex machina is only a phrase. I
don't know if that is a book they've used to make the film. I
don't know. I just I assume the film was
just... Maybe I'm wrong. I've no idea.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I'll have to look that up.
"Deus ex machina" means "the god out of the
machine".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And "ex machina" then is just
"out of the machine".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So, did
you see it? Was something unexpected
coming out of a machine?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well it's,
the film itself what we're
discussing. The premise is: a young man
wins a competition of software encoding,
goes to a secret place where he wins a
prize to spend a week with the boss of
this big company. And then he has to...
That's what he thinks he's won: it's just
being able to spend a week with him. But
actually he's now
going to do the Turing test, which is
the test: "can a I be classed
as human, here's consciousness?" And
that's the film. The film cogent all that.
And, again, I won't talk any more about that
in terms of what the plot is and stuff.
It's worth watching. It's about the
dude's, the young adult,
his, I guess, discovery.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The Turing test is still around. It's I
mean... Turing has been dead for over 50
years. But wait, Turing lived during
the Second World War, so I'm not sure when
exactly he died. But there was an
anniversary a couple of years ago, maybe
for his birth. Anyway
the Turing test, I believe, has prize
money on it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, wow.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, if you can fool
someone, well, if a machine can fool
someone or, you know, act so well like a
human that you cannot tell them apart.
And that doesn't go into looks it's
basically about language and reasoning.
But we're not there yet.
Yeah, it's exciting to see progress in that
area. But making progress
in technology doesn't mean that we're
making progress in understanding how our
own faculty fully works. Philosophers
have discussed this question for a long
time. They call an entity that comes
really close to being and behaving like
a human in every way, but it's not human...
They call that a zombie.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's the
real philosophical term. It's not slang,
at least not anymore. So a zombie
would pass the Turing test. But the
difference is it does not have the
subjective conscious experience that
humans do. And this is something really
hard to pin down and talk about, even for
philosophers, I believe, because it's
controversial. People have very different
views on consciousness, and free will for
that matter. It ties in closely, I believe.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Are we really alive, in the sense that we...
See, I can't even put it into words.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's
hard, isn't it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Oh, it reminds me of that film
with Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman
where the Machine asks Morgan Freeman... Or
no, first Martin Freeman ask the machine
"can you prove that you're self-aware?" And
the machine says "can you?". It's called
"transcendence". It's great. It
came out about five years ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay. Don't think I've
see that one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's great.
Yeah, Johnny Depp dies, and so he uploads
his consciousness into a computer just
before. He has a wife who's also genius.
And she helps him
stay alive. Because humanity is getting
really critical. And will there be
destruction. And then you have to wait
to find out if that really happens,
you know, or if it can be thwarted, or if it
really is a danger, and so on. It's great.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's really funny because I remember
seeing that come out in terms of like
the trailers and stuff, and be like "I
want to see that" and then being like
"okay, I'll watch it when it comes out
like on DVD or whatever" and then you just
forgot about it completely. I have no
remembrance of it at all, wow.
until you just mentioned it.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> If
you're not constantly in touch with
cinema you tend to be...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I tend to be kind
of on the ball with these things because
I love. You know how much I love
any media that tells story. Media,
medium. That tells a story. But do you think
in, personally, do you think that we in
the next... or how long do you think we'll
take, I mean, to be honest I think it'll
happen.
I personally... maybe you're different.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You
mean conscious machines?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<h2 id="are-humans-mere-machines">Are Humans Mere Machines?</h2>

<p><b>William:</b> Uhm, I have a
different view. I really enjoy the
Australian philosopher David Chalmers on
this topic. And I watched some of the
interviews with him. And I can't say
for certain, obviously, but I like how he
says that no matter how complex machines
get, no matter how many artificial neurons you put together in a network,
you will never achieve the same kind of
consciousness that humans experience. So
he makes a hard difference, a strict
difference between artificial
intelligence and, I guess, natural
intelligence. And so... Sorry?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The question there
is... because we're machines in
biology. We have electrical
currents going through us. So ultimately we'll just
come full circle, won't we? We will get to
the point where through machine and
biology we just combine the two to be
able to make humans. Is that not...?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's a popular view. That's right. I'm glad you raised
that and not just go along with what I'm
saying because, yes, a lot of people
believe that we are just a biological
machine.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Ok. Yeah, I don't know what I personally believe, but I'm just throwing in different viewpoints.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, it's important that we
mention especially the questions that
a lot of people have. And this is a
common question. What's the name of
the English physicist who died recently?
Hawking, Stephen Hawking. I read...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> He passed away?! Wow. Sorry.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yes. he did, a few years ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh
my goodness. This is hilarious. I'm going to literally look this up
because it's just... this
happens a lot with me.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
miss a lot of stuff too but...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, March. Wow, yeah.
Again, okay, with my health stuff, my memory and that. It's, yeah...
I would have... The time I think...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> He was
just on the Big Bang Theory a few years
ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay, I must have... Obviously I would have seen it. I would
have known that he had passed away. Again.
because of health stuff my memory, it's
just gone.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Information overload? You
can't go away?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I don't know what it was.
My stupid health, he ability to
retain memory at the moment...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Are you
saying that you knew at one point and
forgot?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, well I would have had, it
would been on Facebook or whatever
else I use. So I would have known,
but the problem gets where you tell me, you said, he died.
And I'm like "I can't remember", I'm
like "okay, that sounds right", but there's
no grounding in my brain where I can go.
There is no point of reference.
I remember hearing it at that point.
So I question the reality of it just
for myself, knowing you're right, but not
having any context for myself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's
confusing.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, it can be it can be really difficult
sometimes.
Yeah, there's certain things,
there's no rhyme or reason to
it. Anyway,
off-topic.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I mentioned Stephen Hawking
because he was very popular. He was
stubborn. But his views had a big
influence on people. Anyway, he said... Every
time he made a new discovery, or in science
in general made a new discovery,
he believed... he felt confirmed, so that
his view became more likely to be true,
which is that we are just matter in
action and there's nothing immaterial
behind it. He likes to say at the end of
an explanation "and since we know now how
this works there is no more need for God".
Because, as you know, one reason that
religion is popular is whenever people
hit a wall with their explainability,
with their knowledge on a topic they
like to say "...and everything beyond that
is up to God".
Since our brains are so, let's go
with finite,, and God's isn't this is
something that he can understand that we
can't. And I think that's true, you know, in
a sense. But I like to think that God can
tell us everything. So therefore
nothing is really unaccessible. It just
might not be in our control. We cannot
always force progress or knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's
a way of just saying "etc., etc." or "and so on
and so forth." We have got this point of
knowledge that's as far as we can go at
a specific period of time.
And that's to be able to understand that we
can't understand it yet. We can't assume
it...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> How can we know what we cannot know?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, we kind of submit and go "okay, well,
sometimes ignorance is bliss. And we will
get there at some point, but right now we
don't." It's like there has
to be an answer. Why can't it just put "dot dot dot,
and just we'll get there eventually. Give
us time."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, you know, a Black Swan might
come along. And it wouldn't be a Black
Swan if you expected it. So there are
emergent... there are emergent phenomena
like that where knowledge suddenly makes
a leap
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But... I forgot how we got onto
the topic.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Stephen Hawking, at the end
of his statements...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So when
scientists or people making discoveries
or even people catching up on already
existing knowledge, you know, knowledge
that is in the human society already,
when they catch up, and this happens to
me too, I start noticing
patterns in nature, and I say "wow this
explanation is really good and explains
this and this and answers this question
I always had", and you get so confident
that you start believing this can
explain everything or it'll just be
another five to ten years until we can
explain everything. And that is not
advisable, not careful.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I get very
confused by the whole "looking for the
one question that answers everything".
I find it very ignorant and, again,
it's just me being a kind of human
being with not much knowledge of
anything, really. But I find it very
strange because at any given point
something can prove a situation, and then
time goes by, something happens which
contradicts that.
It doesn't change the other thing, it doesn't
change that at that point the proof
that was a certain way... Again, it's proof.
It's not just a theory. Life is contradictory.
It's paradoxical. There is a 
Dune quote. I won't go into it. It
talks about how paradox is just an
entertaining thing. People
that get wound up in paradox need to
chill out. That's the Steven way of
interpreting the quote because
actually paradox is just part of
existence. And so why... and
contradiction... why do we need to suddenly say
that was wrong and now this is
right. We have an obsession with that,
I think, as a species.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, I think the
more humble scientists say that
scientific discoveries are really just
theories, and you can never prove that
they're true. You can just show that
they're true in certain contexts and
certain experiments. And they are assumed
to be true until they're disproven. So
every theory is falsifiable but not
really provable.
They would need to test it in every
possible situation and we don't even
know how to do that. We would need to
know everything about everything to have
absolute certainty about something to be
true. So the theory doesn't just mean
some discovery that meta-scientists
formulated, but also something, like most
people use the word, something not
certain.
</p>

<h2 id="can-consciousness-be-recreated-artificially">Can Consciousness Be Recreated Artificially?</h2>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And, I guess, linking it back to
the robotics side of things, where that's
what we're exploring as a humanity:
projecting our, I guess, our desire to
discover who we are as beings
by creation, because that's pretty much
how we will always do it, and creating a
machine robot that reflects ourselves is
a way to explore ourselves, because
you're creating something that is like
you or like us as a species. I
guess you'd have to do it, again, I don't
do robotics, but you'd have to get and go
through so much data, so much, you have to
understand so much philosophy, so much
emotions. You have to understand...
It hurts my head, trying to think about
it... then be able to create something like
that, that does it by itself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But, so when
you do create something that behaves
similarly to you, or to a human in
general, then I think the next step
is that you believe that what you did to
make this machine the way it is is the
same that made you who you are. I
remember when... This blew
my mind the first time I sat in a
lecture about logic in computer science,
and I realized that the formulas, the
logical formulas that we're writing down,
explaining something mathematical, just
not as complex as something
about human behavior; just something
in math, something abstract... I thought "okay
this describes the behavior. But at the
same
people believe that this IS the behavior.
That this is what generates the
behavior in the first place." But I
believe that there's still a step in
between, and that they might just seem
the same but they don't have to be the
same.
Does that make sense? hen I say, when
I say "oh, you seem to drink orange juice
every second day", and I watch you. Say 
this is with someone I live with so that
I get I can notice this really every day.
And then so I set up this rule. I can
write it down mathematically if I want
to. Every second day this person drinks
orange juice, and the other days
they don't, but usually you don't have to
say that. Anyway, now does the
person do that because they had a rule
written somewhere inside of their brain
that that is what they do? Or is it that
they they drink orange juice every time
they feel sad and that's just how
they deal with it? And for some totally
different reason they feel sad; it's just
a coincidence that they feel sad every secon day.
So the rule is "let's do
something totally different, but..."
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Where did the rule come from? Ìs it wired into our being? Is it a
consequence of variables throughout the
past of their existence? So it wasn't
necessarily why I did again environment
type factors that can change at any point
in life. Or is it, as you say,
they've just consciously decided? "Well
okay, I just wanna... I'm gonna have it
every other day because that's it we're
gonna stick to." To me, I mean it's more, but it's, to me there's
three different things going on there.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay. I already forgot the first two. So
tell me: environmental factors?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The first one is
hardwired into their system.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So DNA, genetics, whatever, coded... who
knows that there's something in there that
was gonna make them always get to the
point where they were gonna have orange juice
every second day.
Or they go through life and just think
things happen, environment, external factors.
Maybe, like you say,
their mom used to do it every second day.
Who knows. They decided that they... that's more of a
philosophy.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And the third
one was conscious choice.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Conscious
choice: that kind of crossed over there a little
bit from environmental conscious choice.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, they're not totally clearly
divisible.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I'm trying to divide something
that isn't actually, you know, separated
out so I can understand those three
different points, but actually they all
intertwine. whatever.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So it is really
useful though. The first two points are
very similar to the nature versus
nurture debate.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, that's the obvious
one.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And the third one is relevant for
our discussion about consciousness and
free will, because certain people, I mean
a lot of people, believe that conscious
decision-making is just an epiphenomenon,
it's just something that we tell
ourselves exists, but actually it's just
an illusion; and everything we do is
predictable or, what's the other word,
determined, so that our behavior is
deterministic. And machines are
deterministic, at least the way they are
right now.
You say one day they might not be, and
that's interesting. But yeah, it's
really difficult to know how I make
decisions. You could say... You can reduce
a lot of what I do back to something
else in the past, like the way I was
raised.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The things already mentioned; or
just how I work. And I do a lot of things
without consciously knowing that I'm
doing them, like I heard once that you
are attracted to someone if when you
kiss your saliva chemically harmonizes.
Or just pheromones that you give off,
you can like them about someone else and
then you're attracted to them. So there are all
these factors that you don't know are
working on you, and they influence your
decision-making. So things like that
certainly show that there is truth to
this unconscious decision-making. But
does it mean that everything works that
way? I think that would be too far-reaching and, again, extrapolating from
the knowledge you do have to "oh this is
how everything works".
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. I
always find important not to jump to
absolutes; again, just one thing I've learnt
from Dune, where you say THIS is how it
is. Well no, this is how I believe
it is, but there's a
hundred different factors that I'm
going to absorb, listen to, take on
board that can also be right, or
could be part of the equation.
Right and wrong very absolute terms,
trying to express the variation of
the situation. It's difficult.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, I
think it's a matter of arrogance or
humility. At least once you have
reached a point where you become aware
that you're aware. That's
critical too. So if you think about
children, they do a lot of things out of
necessity, just automatically, basically.
But something will change, and it's a
process,
I don't know if it can happen all of
a sudden.
But when they become aware how their
decision-making works and that they can
actually change what they want to do...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Isn't it in the test, the sweet test.
You put a child, honestly, a
table, and you give them sweet in front
of them, and you say "if you wait ten
minutes you get two sweets", And the
child just sits there; and most children just eat the one sweet because they feel
the necessity just... they're like "this is
good now. I love it."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Is it important for
the test that you leave the room?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes. I
think so, yeah. They're on their own with
the sweet.
I think it's again it
does many different things. But I think, again,
it shows what you just said,
where you learn a point where you
actually, you can override the conscious
impulse to eat the good thing or sugar
egg, to realize that you
get something better if you wait or
something, it's a better, a positive outcome
if you just wait. Because I think that's what a lot of choices are. I think
a lot of choices are action and
reaction. It's something happens to you
and you automatically respond. It's
putting up a wall in my, again, this is my opinion, that free will is where you're
able to put up a wall and go "okay, just
pause for five seconds and do a bit
of conscious choice-making, to then
make the decision, to then do what you
want to do. Because again, it's not necessarily about what is
right or wrong, it's what you as an
individual want to do in that situation.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You might want to go and punch the
person, that's an example
here, is if you're in an argument or
something, and your impuls is, let's say,
fight, fight or flight. And in
the past it seems you've just done it out of
impulse. You hit the person and then
you got in trouble, or whatever, or you've not. If you can get the point where you
can go "No, I don't want to hit the person",
walk away or "Yes, I do want to do it" and
then still do it; that shows a conscious
choice-making situation, again, in my
view, my little naive view.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You know, I
think that's really a good perspective
for this topic. It's easy for us to look
at children and say "oh they've just made...
they've just taken a step to another
level of consciousness", and then it helps
to, when I remind myself that I'm not
that different from children. I've made
certain changes but I can still make
lots and lots of changes. So I'm just on
one of the many steps on this staircase
towards higher and higher consciousness, you could say. I also love that you
used the word "respond". I can respond
to the situation, I mean impulsively, or I
can just, you know, react without knowing
why or how. Or I can choose how to
respond. And the word responsibility
comes from "respond", because I have the
"ability to respond". I am response-able. And
so that is a power that you can
gain. I'm not sure how exactly the process
works. But you can certainly decide to be
open for it. And then with experience and
just trying over and over you can gain a
higher level of responsibility, of awareness.
And I think that's a very valuable thing
to work on.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Definitely. On the flip side,
just to throw a contradictory example,
discussion out there, is you can spend
too long thinking and worrying about
things. You can
over-analyze. A lot of my anxiety
and depression problems come from that.
They've come from just sitting there and
thinking too much about a situation and
not just letting my own impulses do the
thing. Because sometimes
I'm like "Okay, is this the right way? Is this
the wrong way?", in the past. Now I just go
to that core thing of what do I want,
what makes me happy? And then I just do it.
And if it goes wrong or seems to go
wrong I'm like "meh, whatever it doesn't
matter. It's what I wanted to do. I tried
it." I have that integrity and that
happiness that I did it. No matter what happens
that went or what goes wrong. I'm like
"Wow, yeah. Go me. I had the consciousness
to just do what I thought would help me
be happy."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The non-useful
thoughts, do they go in circles? Is that
what you're talking about?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> They can do, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You try to analyze and be
all cognizant, but it never leads
anywhere.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, yeah.
Again, that's where children come in.
I mean, you're example of
humility links back to kids because
you're showing you're humble by looking at
them as an example, because we're not
much different from them. We are not-
We think as adults we think we've
suddenly become this higher being than
those, the universe and knows how much
more in children. But children just
they are such prime examples of so
many different things, and fun, fun and
play. We talk about last time or
talked about it befor where, yeah, just it was
last time: being able to play is a
great way to learn, just having fun and
not overthinking things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> CBT stands for cognitive behavioral
therapy, and the cognitive therapy part
is the self-analyzing. trying to figure
out what's going on, thinking about
your own thoughts and seeing how you can
change those patterns, to help. But
behavioral part is what you're just
talking about, at least I believe that's
what behavioral therapy is about: how you
just need to do something sometimes; just
act out what you believe to be right or
what you believe to be healthy in the
moment, without knowing it in theory, you
know, in your brain. And both are
necessary for mental health or for
health in general.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> A lot of it is to do with fear
fear, of getting it wrong or making a
fool of ourselves, or whatever the
reasons that we prefer just to think
about it and go through it in our brains.
And again, in our brains we... often it
lies to us. It tells us things like
this social situation is gonna be scary
or whatever. And in many ways it's a self-fulfilling
and prophecy where, because you think
it's scary, your brain
releases the biological side of things, yeah, anxiety; when actually if
you just went and did it, and didn't think about it,
you'd be like "okay, cool this is fun or
whatever else".
That's what I got stuck in way back. But again, I
keep trying to refer this back to the
original sort of questions about
robotics. Do you think that they
could make a machine, I guess, express
what we're expressing, because you know more about
these things than I do.
Expressing awareness of fear?
Awareness of fun through learning?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Let me give you a high-level
answer that doesn't go into so much
detail. The first thing that jumps to my
mind is Kurt Gödel. Have you heard of
him? He was a mathematician in the 30s, at
least that's when he made
his huge contributions. He was a
party-pooper.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> ...Because I had worn
my mouse and anyone ever...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I like
to call him that because people at the
beginning of the 20th century were so
excited about all these new discoveries
about logic. So you know we're excited
about technological advances in the last
few decades. But they were excited about
the theoretical advances about
understanding math and logic better and
what you can write down on paper about
nature. So do you see the link, yeah?
You first need to understand these things in
theory before you can recreate them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Definitely.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> David Hilbert, at the turn of
the century came up with, I don't know,
15 problems or so that he formulated for
scientists in the 20th century and he
said if you have nothing to work on, try
one of these. And there were really
difficult problems. You can look on
Wikipedia which of them have been solved,
which have't been solved.
Sorry?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think I've heard of those.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Good. And I think maybe a third of them
are solved, and that's about it. But one
of them was: can you describe everything
that happens in the universe
mathematically? And people believed yes.
They were very optimistic about this
problem. And then Kurt Gödel came along
and he showed that "Nope". He
didn't have to go through every possible
situation and show, and find one that
doesn't work. He showed that
mathematically in itself, mathematics in
itself is incomplete. It doesn't mean
it's wrong or useless. It just means it
has its limitations. For example,
when you create a formula, when you write down
a formula that is trying to express
something about itself, and this is
similar to a machine trying to think
about itself,
it's analogous, in theory it's
the same. When you, when you try to do
that it is possible, but only to a
certain extent. Because there are certain
formulas, mathematical formulas, that will
express something and you can derive it
to be true from basic truths. I'll give
you an example of some of the logical
steps that you can make in mathematics:
modus ponens is a rule that is
when you have two rules one of them says
if A then B, and the second one says A
which means A is true; and the first one
says if A is true then B must be true. If you combine the two if you say
that both are true then you can know as
a consequence that B is true.
You know that A is true and
we know that if A is true then B is true.
If you combine the two you get B, or B
is true. So that's one basic rule that
most people most scientists can agree on
in most situations it holds true. You can
come up with some quirky situations but
it doesn't, but let's stay in the
common sense area. And so you have a set
of these, maybe a dozen. And you you can
express infinitely many very complex
things about nature or any mathematical
system. And the the logic
will be consistent for that. If X is true
then it's negation must be false, right?
If I say
sun is shining and it is, then the
sentence "the Sun is not shining" must be
false. But with the mathematical
logic that we have, that we're using
right now. the standard arithmetics, you
can derive a sentence, the system will
predict that the sentence is true and
that its negation is true.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So, I
don't remember how, I looked at a proof
once. It's complicated. But Kurt Gödel
came up with this in the 30s and
showed that the mathematical system has
been very useful, but it has its
limitations, because obviously something
and it's negation cannot
always be true at the same time. And so
that shows that No, that the
mathematical system we were using right
now is not able to cover everything. We
cannot express everything with it. And
that to me is fundamentally important
because it shows that there are still
things outside of the very system,
the language, the mode of thinking
that we use to make sense of nature, our
environment and ourselves. Sp I hope
that you can see the connection
between that discovery and your question
about self conscious machines. As long as
we build machines based on the
mathematics we use right now, I believe
that they will at least be limited.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You might be able to create zombies.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well we're limited as well, so. So I guess our limitation
creates the limited
machine. Therefore we need
to improve our own limitations
to be able to create.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The last thing we
said was
humans are limited in our thinking
in our scientific methods. And then you
said that then it's no surprise that the
machines that we create are also limited.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And that makes a lot of sense since,
I believe, you need to be at a higher
level than the thing you create because
basically you need to be able to create
everything it does, you need to be able
to understand everything it does.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Interesting point, because again, creation
often happens through accident, I guess. like just random chaos, I guess. I
don't think people realized exactly what
they're doing when they split the atom. I
mean,
maybe they did. I don't know. But
is it something they planned for?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There are examples that what
you're talking about. Like penicillin was
discovered accidentally.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, so leaps in
technology can... that's where,
again, all the I guess
disaster films come from where it's like
"do we jump forward in robotics?" It's the
point where we actually create something
that is beyond us. And then...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> We
should definitely discuss that another
time.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I think it would be a good part two. I think this
is a good ongoing discussion
that could quite easily take up
another session.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Of course, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So if you
want to...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Some people call this topic "AI
safety". Elon Musk is a big proponent
of being more careful and not just going
for every idea you have. Especially
people do that when there are economic
incentives behind it. He had a fight, you
could say, a debate with Mark Zuckerberg
on Twitter once. But they went back and
forth what is safe to do? When
should you be more careful and not care
so much about all the money that you
could make just because you're the first
to try this new approach?
Yeah, it's a big
topic.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It is, it really is.
Have you felt like you've
discussed a lot of what you wanted to in
this session?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, obviously it
evolved organically, just
like you predicted. And I didn't expect
to go into mental health or some of the
history of mathematics. But it's all
related, obviously. So yeah, I'm very happy
with the way it's gone. And we could
spend another hour on it, which would
definitely make another episode.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I'm happy to do that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Good. What do you think about the idea of
sometime in the future also getting on
someone else to speak with us or with
one of us about a topic?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. I'm always
yeah like I mean, I just kind of just
talked about limitations like it's
always good to get another viewpoint. It'd be
nice. Wouldn't it be amazing if we can link
up you know seven billion
people and get a lot of different
perspectives together? But again,
limitations; so having someone else that
has a perspective and knowledge and is
always good fun, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It doesn't have to
be an expert, just another voice that
brings some diversity.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. Again,
we're not exactly experts.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, you are in many things.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well,
I studied certain things, and you could
tell I'm really excited to talk about
them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And I'm happy to have this
outlet, this way to express them.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I like
listening to them. I've always went...
In our previous discussions. I've
lost number of years. I've really
enjoyed because we were very different
in our own knowledge base, I guess.
I guess that's what happens as
humans. But just you have such a
incredible understanding of, again, the coding,
computing language and how it relates
to humans, to us. And you do a
very good job of humanizing it all.
Because a lot of times I separate myself
from that kind of stuff because to me it
feels so foreign to how my own
perspective perceives things, that it seems
unhuman. But actually the way you break
it down and talk about it really helps
me to open my mind more to that. I
think I still very rarely
understand it, but it just gives me a
little bit of knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
know what I mean, yeah. I think it's
sad when people strictly try to separate
the science from what it means for us in
everyday life. And humanization is
important, like the ethics question for
example. That should always come along
with the scientific development. You
shouldn't just do something because it's
fun or because there's lots of money in
it. Progress isn't always all good, or
at least you should say there are
different types of progress.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, again,
it's intention, isn't it. Ontention behind
the progress.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, and the
unintended consequences that you need to
repair afterwards...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Which, I guess, is a
good link. Right there actually. 
That question could be our starting
point for next session: the
intentions behind creating, again,
machines that have consciousness and
affect our day-to-day lives potentially.
And (1) why you want to do that? And (2)
should we do that? (3) Is it
she worthwhile? These things we can
discuss, I guess.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Definitely, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> To start
with. Maybe you have our
ideas. But just...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, I have tons of ideas,
just in response to the things you were
saying. But I'd better write them down, and not try to cover them all now.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There we go.
</p>
