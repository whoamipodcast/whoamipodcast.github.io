<p><b>Steven:</b> Hello, welcome to the podcast "Who am I".
I'm Steven.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And I'm William
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And this is episode 2. Welcome.
Last podcast was
really fun and we had a good time,
just chatting away. You've been working hard
on all the editing and stuff, so that's
much appreciated.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that was an interesting process. I
got to learn about video editing,
uploading, publishing. And pretty soon I
will have the transcript ready to put on
the webpage. And then hopefully our pages
will become more searchable that way.
Also, I really want us to make a trailer.
I'm going to collect some material for
that. It could just be cutouts from the
show.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Maybe funny moments, maybe
dropping my phone could be part of it.
It must be good for something, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Organizing a podcast from
scratch and what big things could go
wrong.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Exactly, yeah. But there's no time
pressure. It just takes however long it
takes. But it'll become a
routine and go quicker. So I look forward
to that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes.
