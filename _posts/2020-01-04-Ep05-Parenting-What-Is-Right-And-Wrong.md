description: As a young person enters the new adventure of becoming a parent, they are confronted with challenges they can never be truly prepared for, no matter how much knowledge they acquired beforehand. Making mistakes and learning from them in practise seems to be the only way for us to progress, be it as children or as parents.

<p><b>William:</b> Alright. Hello everyone. We're
back. This is William and Stephen from whoamipodcast.com
Today we want to speak about the
topic that we left open in last episode,
and that is about parenting. It kind of
was a natural successor of last episode,
when we talked about early childhood
development, about sexual identity and
your place in your family situation and
society. And now we want to talk about
the role of the parent and the child, the
dynamics between the two. Steven and
I are both not parents. But we have
thought about this topic, and as always
we have more questions than answers.
But we would like to share those with
you. You can comment on our
discussion on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
whatever. So I guess we can divide the
question about parenting into two, at
least two, where we can think from the
perspective of the child, you know "What
was it like for us, being raised?", and
secondly "How would we raise a child?",
which is obviously hypothetical, not
going from personal experience, but living
experience with babysitting or
anything else that might help with this
question.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Like you said with babysitting and stuff
is that I've got four nieces and a nephew.
You have...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I have two nieces and one nephew,
at the moment.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> So we've been
directly involved with the family side
of things. And then we've both been
amongst various different cultures and
people where we've had the opportunity
to interact with both parents and
children on a weekly basis, really,
through education. I went to a summer
camp in America, and with about six or seven year olds, I
think it was, for three months, and then
interacting with parents when they came
by. And there's plenty of I
guess experience there.
