description: Craig Irving and I exchange our views on the terrible trends around the world&colon; propaganda in mainstream news media, censorship in social media, fascist actions by many governments, disinformation campaigns, etc. It is difficult not to conclude that behind such seemingly random happenings is a global central force with its own ideology and agenda for humanity as a whole.
