<p><b>William:</b> As you
know, this show is all about personal
identity. It's good to look for examples
out there of the kinds of personality
you want for yourself, the kinds of
things you want to keep you busy. It must
be really nice to have that guidance. How
much of your path do you choose for
yourself? You said there is a still small
voice that guides you. But does it
take any difficult decision-making
on your own part?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, and I have to
keep going back to this, William, because
I'm a Christian. Okay so with me being a
Christian, my relationship with God is
what helps me to make those hard
decisions. There is a scripture in the
Bible that says, "If you
acknowledge God and everything that you
do he will direct your path." And so
that's what helps me to make those hard
decisions. When I come in contact with
the hard decision I begin to inquire of
God as to what I need to do. And besides
praying I also look at Scripture as
well. And that's what helps me in my hard
decision making.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right, yeah. Can you give
us an example of what it's like to feel
that spirit, that voice?
Because I think this is what a lot of
people would like more of in their life,
but they don't quite know how to.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, I
think it's... One thing that you have
to do: you almost kind of gotta like
quiet your spirit down, kind of like shut
out all the outside noise. A lot of times,
and I'm guilty of it you know, we'll get
in the car, first thing most people do
they turn on the radio, you know. It's
almost like people are
uncomfortable with it just being quiet.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Right.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> And so sometimes you just kind of,
in a sense you have to just still away.
And sometimes it's not all about much
talking but just meditation. Meditation.
The scripture talks about that a lot. And
so just getting to a quiet place, kind of
like quieting your spirit. And then for
my process, you know, I'll pray to God,
and then I listen. Because a lot of times
people will kind of like get what they
need to get off their chest. But they
never wait for God to say anything. They never
wait for God to say anything. And I
always say: think about this, just like me
and you. We are having this discourse. And
if I'm constantly talking, right, and I'm
not giving you a chance to intercept,
you're gonna be feeling some kind of way
about it, like in a sense that you may
feel as though "Oh, she's trying to make
this all about her", and that
she doesn't take into account, or she
doesn't really care about what I think,
or say. And so, it's the same way when we
come before God. Yes, you
can say what you need to say. But then
you need to wait to see if he will say
anything to you. And that's my
process. And a lot of times for me, and I
only can talk about my own experience,
God deals with me a lot in dreams. So
there are times when I could like, for
instance, if I come in contact with
people and
they really want to try to get a
connection in my life, I'll pray and I
say, "God, if this person is not for me, you
show me, or you tell me." That's the
most simplistic prayer that I pray. And
if you don't show me anything, I know
this individual is good. But if he does,
then I know I need to take heed to that
warning.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Wow, yeah. That's amazing. I
personally believe myself that that kind of
communication is possible. It's just
special when it does happen. So for
me it's not an everyday occurrence.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> No,
it's not every everyday occurrence.
Actually I've only heard God speak to me
once audibly. Okay and it basically
just called my name. And I'll share this
quick story: I had just started working
at a job. Matter of fact I just got hired.
And I thought I had set my alarm, or
whatever. But I heard someone
call my name, and I know it was
nobody but the Lord, because
I was the only one in the
house. And he said my name is clear as
day:
Aleechea. And I woke up, and I
called my mom. I said, "Mom", I said, "God
didn't want me to be late to work today,
because I sure would have overslept.
Because I thought I had set the alarm
clock. That alarm never went off. But I
heard my name being called as clear as
day." No one in the house. And that was my
audible experience.
And then, like I say the other times, it's
either he speaks to me through
the scripture, the Bible, or
he'll give me an unction. He'll
give me something in my spirit to say,
"This is the way that you need to
go."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I heard it said once that
if you want to reach God, pray. If you
want him to speak to you, read in the
scriptures.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes, yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So those are some of
the common channels that we have.
Let's see. Can you give us some examples
of
your service in the local community,
whether it's in prisons or through
church? What kind of groups can you go to
to have an impact on people?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, as I
said earlier, I work with the police
department as... I am the first
Afro-American female police chaplain for
the Millville Police Department. Now if
you know anything about Millville, New
Jersey, they were known for Klu Klux Klan
meetings and rallies and different
things of that nature.
That's number one. But one of my services
to the police officers:
I go to their police briefings. I do
ride-alongs also. And basically, what I do
is, I'm just there to avail myself to
them. I'm not there to push religion on
them. I'm not there to convert them in
any kind of way. I'm just simply there,
making myself available. We have a
terminology in chaplaincy that's called
Ministry of presence. Sometimes saying
nothing means everything. Just you being
there. It's kind of like sometimes you
can, you know, when you want to go talk to
someone, sometimes you're not, you know,
you don't want any advice; you just want
someone to listen to you.
And God gave me this message, and he said,
"Many people listen to respond than
listening to understand." And the example
that I always give is if me and you are
talking and, say for instance, in the
middle of my thought process, as I'm
conveying it to you, you may
interrupt me and say, "Oh yeah, like such
and such," and I may say to you, "Wait a
minute. That's not what I'm saying. Listen
to what I'm saying." And so, when we really
listen to understand, then we're able to
give the proper response. Like I tell
people, "If I'm talking to you and you're
in your mind already trying to conjure
up what you're going to come back to me
with, you're
not listening to understand. You're
listening to respond." And so if I really
listen to understand then I'm able to
give you the proper response. As a matter
of fact, if I'm really listening to
understand what you tell me, I can use
that information to help serve you.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah,
that's true.
If I am a bit distracted and not
properly listening to you right now it's
mainly because of the technical stuff
around me not being as reliable as I had
hoped.
No, but I'm having fun in this
conversation. Another title I found of
you on your homepage is a "psalmist". Now
what does that mean?
</p>

<div class="insertable" id="James Cleveland.png"></div>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Just a singer.
That terminology is really used like in
churches. But one of the singers
that I really admire, she works with the
gospel music workshop of America. There
was a Reverend James Cleveland who was
very known for gospel music. He was
a pianist. And so this gospel
music workshop of America, it is a big
organization. All different kind of
gospel groups come together. They have
conventions and different things of this
nature.
And one day she said to me, "You are a true psalmist."
And she said, "What I mean by that
is you make a song your own." So even if I
sing someone else's song I don't have to
sing exactly how this person presented
it or how they sung it. I make it my own.
And that's what a true psalmist is, is
making that song their own thing, their
owning it, you know. They've had their own
unique character to it,
you know.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You interpret it to express
what you feel yourself, right?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that's a good point for not
just music but also literature. How do you manage to interpret say the
Bible?
Since it can be pretty confusing, and
different people have pretty different
interpretations. How do you get from it
that inspiration that you were
mentioning?
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> Well, again, I have to go to
scripture, and I'm glad you allow me to
do this because what I tell people: "Yes,
Aleechea is human. Yes, Aleechea is a reverend.
But you also have to remember, Aleechea is
a Christian." So that is a part of who I
am. Let me share this before I
answer your question: There was a friend of
mine, and she said she wanted to talk to
me. She said, "But I don't want to talk to
the pastor. I'm gonna talk to Aleechea. Okay?
And so I broke that down to her and said,
"Well, you got to remember: Even if I take
the pastor part and put that aside, your
friend is still a Christian. So I'm still
gonna give you the
same answer because as a Christian I'm
living according to biblical principles."
And so after the spiel of
course she was like, "You know what?
You're absolutely right."
I woulda gave her the same answer. So
with that being said, how I interpret in
regards to my literature and everything:
There's a scripture that says, "Study to show
yourself approved unto God, not being
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth." And the only way you can really
rightly divide what the Bible says, it
has to be, number one, God-inspired. You
need the Holy Spirit which is a
guide a guider to you, it is a
counselor to you. And then even sometimes
you may have to ask God for the
interpretation, simply praying. The
scripture says that, "If any man lacks
wisdom, let him ask of God, and God will
give it to this man liberally." So
sometimes it's just a matter of asking,
"Okay, I'm not understanding what this
says. Can you give me, can you open up my
eyes of understanding so I'm able to
grasp what is being... what you're trying
to convey to me?"
And that's pretty much... and I believe
for myself: as a young child, and my mom
could tell you, no one had to tell me
what the Bible meant. I was able to
understand it, and I believe that is a
gift of revelation, knowledge. Some
people have it, some people don't. But I
had it at an early age, where my mom
didn't have to explain to me, "Okay. This
is what this means."
I knew it, so I know that it was a gift.
It was a gift from God. Now keep in mind
I am a 4th generation preacher. So I have
preachers, I mean this is how I tell
people: I was practically near born at
the altar. So it's been
instilled, and it's been engrafted in me.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Wow, yeah. That's special. Because there is
so much to gain from the Bible. But it
can be cryptic for a lot of people.
</p>

<p><b>Aleechea:</b> And
William, let me make this disclaimer: I don't understand
everything that's in there, you know.
And some things God, he... the scripture even
says, "He leaves things to a mystery."
Because the truth of the matter is: I
don't care, you could be the Pope of the
Pope. There's always something in your
life that you can work on. There's always
something that you can learn. When you
stop learning you stop
living. And as a matter of fact the Bible
says, he said, "We
are ever learning and coming into the
knowledge of the truth." So we
should always have a teachable spirit to
be able to learn. And if you get to that
point where you can't learn from someone,
then you're in a bad place,
and you're in trouble.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, that
makes a lot of sense.</p>
