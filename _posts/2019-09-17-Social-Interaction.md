<p><b>William:</b> So you have to
spend time with who?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> With lots of quiet people, people that tend
to be
not as outgoing as maybe the
popular group of people, like the masses.
And therefore, sometimes in the past, I
felt the need to be the one who chats
even though I'm quite happy to sit back
and, not in a social environment, if everyone
was just not talking and no one's saying
anything,
that feels very uncomfortable. It
feels like something's wrong, so it's not
right, where actually it's just enjoying each
other's presence. But there usually
has to be something, you're doing
something. If you're all together,
you know, you're watching a film or on
the computer or you're playing board
games, you know. You don't have to
necessarily talk to each other in that.
But if you're just sitting there
having drinks or whatever, then it can be
quite difficult to know
what to say and how to maintain
conversation.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Sometimes it's just a
mental pause, just reflecting on what was
said.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I always love when someone comes in and it's
like they're the person that can sort of
like navigate the conversation, the
dynamic in the group. I can
just sit back, and I don't have to, but I
can sort of just bounce off that person.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, it can be nice. It can also be that
they take over too much control and then
the whole dynamic gets ruined, where
everyone had a good share in the
conversation. When someone has a
personality that's too big for the rest
of the group.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I interrupted, carry on. Sorry.
Well, see, I'm doing exactly what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So shall we move on to another topic?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, the link in my brain was: an
example of that dominating conversation
in a group setting is Dungeons & Dragons of all things. So that's really popular
at the moment. It's made an
absolutely comeback in the last
four or five years.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> The pen and paper
version in person?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> In person, online, again,
broadcasting it, twitch streaming it,
YouTube streaming it. If you go onto youtube
and type in D&D there are hundreds of
shows because it's very entertaining.
The social dynamic of that is that
you have one person guiding the story
scenario then you have four people plus
or maybe three, depending on the dynamic,
and in
social situation there's one person
that dominates the whole thing. It can be
a completely different different game to where
if it's even spread. You have the other
dynamic the dungeon master or games
master: it's their job to actually
negotiate that, to make sure that one
person isn't dominating things. So it brings in
a whole new social structure. And I know
people falling out in dungeons and dragons
and got upset because one person was
trying to control the situation to make
sure everyone, like the DM is trying to make
sure everyone's having the same amount
of fun, but the big personality... And
they're enjoying it, you know, they're
allowed to enjoy it. They're allowed to have
fun, be happy and whatever else. But it's
those social clues of being aware.
But other people can get involved.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> How
often do you play? Do you meet once a
week with your friends?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I play a
little bit at the moment with my brother Ben.
But I've just finished up a two-year
campaign. Yeah, I just finished a two-year
campaign,
weirdly with somewhere between 15 and
20 people.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> What? Online?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Well, so
originally there's about 13 of us in our
games group who wants to play dungeons and
dragons. And I was like "yeah, let's see
what happens". I hadn't DM'd before. I hadn't
done it. But I thought "you know what, I
always go for the extremes, so I'll try
it". And it works reasonably well, but was
a difficult dynamic because, again, people
weren't getting enough time. I was
constantly jumping to different people a
lot. And then I split it off into more
people jumped in, more people came along.
Then I split it off into three groups of
five or six, and then a group of one
because the story had one sort of
"bad person"
which was my brother as his character.
And then the other groups were on the
quest to try and stop him
all in the same sort of timeline but
different countries. So that was a social
dynamic, nightmare, but lots of fun.
In hindsight I'll never do it again.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And that took two years, to go through the whole
story and the whole adventure?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I
mean some adventures never
stop. So D&D is a weird one where
you can have the campaign last a
year. They can last ten years depending
on the group of people, depending on the
story. Most pre-made things from Wizards
of the coast who make D&D, I think, a year
maybe. If you do it every eight week or two.
It might last, the
curse of Stroud, that's quite a long one.
I think.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So does that mean the Dungeon
Master has to keep building the world?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes, if it's their own world, yes. If it's
the pre-made one they have a general
sense of how the world is.
And they kind of just use the resources
that you've got given, you've been given
for that. But yeah, going back to the point: the social
dynamic of that is fascinating; trying
to listen, again, listen to people, let
them have their time.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Nice. I've
been studying a bit about gamification,
and how central games are to learning,
and how hopefully the education system,
you know schools for children, will adapt.
And now it is that being told to shut up,
sit down and listen is not productive.
There's nothing wrong with you
if you can't sit still and listen for
hours to something that is not exciting
for you. How you can actually use
games, simple games, complex games, board
games, video games to convey all the
things you need in traditional schooling.
So I'm excited about becoming aware of
that and I wonder what things you learn,
because games aren't interesting unless
you learn. I think you were saying
that the social dynamics are
interesting, but what else have you
learned just from games like D&D?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There's a lot of studies going on.
I'm assuming studies and discussion
going on about how this helps especially
in D&D
and role-playing games, because it gives
you a way to, again, learn social
situations that are technically
fictional and there's no consequence
really to it. So you can help develop
your social skills in that manner. A lot
of teenagers right now are really
getting onto it, especially in America.
D&D clubs, groups like stranger
things has really blown that up as well
because the TV show stranger things is
basically based on D&D stuff and has
really blown up that ability to learn
through a story. You know,
if you're acting a story not just reading a
story, you know, people love to see a
theater or read it or see it on TV or
the cinema; this gives you a very
immersive experience where you can learn
anything like you can
learn the social skill, you can learn how
you feel about good and evil, or how you
would feel in a bar brawl. It can
get really emotional because you're attached to your
character, you're playing a character.
And if your couch gets injured or your
party members get injured you go through
emotional learning through those
experiences. And it is just brilliant.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It's like a flight simulator,
right? There's no risk of,
say, physical harm. But you get the
real experience.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, and again, if the DM is
doing it right and you're doing it
right as a group there's no risk
for social or psychological or
emotional damage because you're with
friends, you're in a comfortable
situation. And there should be no
judgement and just having fun. You can be
as silly as you want. You can just
let loose. You don't have to hide. You can
look for aspects of your own personality
through another character if you want to,
without realizing. Other people do
because they're not out and about "I'm
gonna feel judged". They'll just say, you
know, "it's the character", but actually
they might be actually just exploring
part of themselves. And then D&D also
has the element where it's just fun and you
can just kill everything and that
tends to be what happens to start off
with, where you get a party come in and
you put a scenario in front of them and
instead of negotiating or being
diplomatic it's just, because it's a
fictional world, "we draw our bows
and our swords and we go and kill."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> In D&D you say a lot what you do, right?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But when you're with the group of
friends in person or I guess you
say "I do this", which is not normal speech.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> No.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's interesting.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> You have the third person as well you
can say the person's name, your
character's name. You say "Sam does that",
"Sam is upset", "Sam cries", "Sam whatever" if
that's a character's name.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> You could turn that into
a book if you record what everyone says, especially when it's in the third person.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Again, the podcasts; you
just follow someone's game.
If you type it into YouTube, if you type it
into twitch... I got into the audio stuff
about five or six years ago, maybe
a bit more, and
there's so many, just fun games, and
you're just listening to them play. They
just listen to them play. The main
one that I listen to is acquisitions
incorporated, they're the Wizards of the
coast guys that make it, their own
official D&D team, I guess. They have
other ones as well but this one
started off as just a little podcast. Two of the
players I don't think had even
played D&D before. It's been going for ten years.
And then they got to the point after a
few years, where they did it at
conventions on stage in front of
people.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> In costume?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yes,
sometimes in costume. Wil Wheaton was
involved in a few of them.
And yeah, it's just it's so much fun and
entertaining, and, again, you learn like
you do for any fictional medium, really.
The whole catharsis thing.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I don't like
it when when people say "Well, what does
that have to do with the real world? That
doesn't prepare you for anything really
important." But, I mean, reality is what you
make of it, first of all. And a game
or a movie for that matter, no matter how
fictional it is, it's only interesting as
long as it has some relation
with the real world. If it were totally
disconnected and totally abstract it
would not be interesting, you wouldn't
know what's going on and how is this a
story. So there's always some parallel,
and some stories are more distant
from the world we know than others;
but that's just his work.
