<p><b>William:</b> One way it can backfire also is when
when you read online
about different medicines and how people have experienced them. And they'll
tell you they're their most terrible
experiences. And you don't read all the
good experiences that happen to people.
You know they're less likely to be there
in the same thread or website. And so you
will become afraid of medicine, or at
least there's a tendency for that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I was always that way. Medication was always something that I
didn't want. And whenever I did try it
it didn't work. So I mean my first
experience I think was my first year at
university or something massive
depression. And they put me on basic
medication and didn't do anything. It
just didn't help. So that immediate
response in my brain was, "Well, medication
doesn't help. What's the point?", and just
left it. And then over the years tried
different ones, it still didn't help. And yet now,
I found the right one, and it helps, and
it keeps a lot of the anxiety and depression quieter.
It doesn't
fix it, it hasn't fixed it in
terms of made it go away. But it's
manageable.
And it allows me to function relatively
well I mean and not be overburdened by
the depression. As I say, it's
dialled down. It's quietened the
thoughts, compulsions, whatever you want
to call it. And now I'm constantly being
like, "Okay, keep trying with the
medication. Be careful," because again
they can have extreme effects. I've had
situations where... again there's been a
lot of negative side effects of
medication. But once that happens stop, go to the doctor, make sure you
balance it all, and then maybe try
something else. Because there are plenty out
there. And some work for some people, and some
don't work for others, you know.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> It
can be frustrating how much time
this process takes. I know someone who
had to try several different
medications. I think there were SSRIs
(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).
And there is a wide variety. So that
that's a good thing so that
hopefully there's something there for
you. But it's it also means that you
might have to go through several before
you find the one that works for you. And
you might have to go through a painful
phase because
of all the side effects that often come
with them. So this friend had to try
several different SSRIs until he stopped
puking, for example. I mean I had
stomach cramps the first three weeks
that I took my medicine. But after that...
you know even in the night sometime.
But after that I finally after
three weeks, I felt some of the good
effects, which was similar to what you
described, you know, that my brain became
more flexible and then more amenable to
psychotherapy and self-analysis. Because it's common for your thoughts
to go around in circles and never reach
any conclusion.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah. One thing,
away from the medication, that I find that
helps is distraction: If we're talking about
anxiety for example as a mental
health condition, that when I say
a panic attack kicks in (because
I've had to deal with that for a number
of years as well in my life) the fear
response kicks in, and it's it kind of it
can kick in straight away and you have a
massive fight or flight response. And you
know you feel like you're dying where you your body
just goes into absolute panic mode. But
sometimes it's gradual and you can feel
it coming on. And often your brain
just needs to be distracted so that it
can calm down and move away from the
anxiety. And I do that like with a lot of
people, a few friends that have
anxiety. So when they know it's
kicking in and stuff we just go online
and play computer games. It
literally just caused them to be
distracted enough to settle the coming-on panic attack. That's hard to do
when you're out and about for example if
you were in a situation in the community.
There are psychotherapies, there are ways
to push against anxiety. So
my personal example is: I
really had to push against the
connections in my brain that were
triggering panic attacks. I was scared to be outside, scared to be
around people, all those fear patterns
had been developed over the course of a
year or two. And then I had to... again it's
a person experience and it may help some
people it may not help others. I pushed
myself to go out in my own time,
baby steps, went to a board games group,
got to know a few people, and over the
course of months and years gained loads
of confidence, I call it
de-programming: it de-programmed, it broke those
patterns in my brain of being... I
still get a
little bit nervous, a little anxious but
I just go, "Well, I've come this far. I've
done the hard work as such," and
push through. A lot times,
fear response if we listen to them they
get stronger and stronger I think. That's my own
understanding of it. So let's
say we go out, there's loud noises that
don't like if we go away from them
straight away the brain then strengthens
that thought that every time is loud
noise we must run away from it. I don't
know what your views are, if you've
experienced anxiety like that before or
anything like that?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Well, I recognize
the concepts you're talking about.
I have other triggers that are, I don't
know, sometimes just even inside my head,
not even something from the outside. But
the
fight-or-flight response kicks in
because your brain associates something
with an actual threat for your life.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> And as you say, it could just literally be a
thought. It doesn't have
to be an outside response. That's often
the case with anxiety: it's in your mind.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> And then when you do
flee the situation, like you said
avoiding that noise for example...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Which makes perfect sense, you know, to run
away from it. It makes sense to do
that.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But you confirm the bias, and so you
strengthen the anxiety. And the opposite
is confrontation. And I remember when I
first could no longer work because of
anxiety. I said no way
will I ever try confrontation therapy.
But then with time, you know several
years time, I realized that it's not just
the most effective treatment, it
might even be the only effective
treatment for me. We said medicine can
alter your brain. But it's not a
solution. It's just something that will
make it more changeable. But as soon as
you stop the medication, you will pretty
much go back to the way you were before,
maybe even worse unless you did
something in the meantime, working
with someone, working by yourself. But you
know, changing your thought patterns, your
beliefs, and by beliefs I mean
psychological beliefs, not necessarily
religious beliefs, all those
misconceptions about what is actually a
threat.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, I would agree. This is
our experience. So people
might have different opinions.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Sure.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> But I
would totally agree that the thing I
found to help is medication. That
gives you a bit of armor. And then going
and doing
you have to just act you have to find a
way, whether it's through
mindfulness, whether it's through...
We could do all these different
things. You don't have to just pick one but, as
you say, the exposure... I guess I call it
exposure therapy. You called it
confrontation therapy. I don't know what
the actual...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No,
you're right. You have the official name,
and I translated it straight from German.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay.
Again, the thing is I
don't read, I just
listen to some things from time to time.
I just pick up on terminology. But I
don't focus, and if it's the right
terminology or not... So to me
exposure therapy kind of makes sense if
that's what it's called.
And again, it's all in our own
time and our own space, like our own as I say
baby steps is what I always say to people.
You know if you start to feel bit
anxious, then okay, see how it goes. Don't
immediately run away. See how it goes.
Maybe that's it.
Maybe that's your brain then if you tell
yourself as a success that you've stayed
for longer than maybe you would have,
affirm that success. Go away from the
situation and be like, "Yeah, well done. I
made it today. I made it this far." And
then the next day or in a week or whatever,
see if you can do it again. And then go,
"Yeah, well done, success." It doesn't have to
constantly be pushing forwards, until
you're ready. There's many, many
what can be classed as failures on my
part. I'll go to the board game
group, have a massive panic attack, go home and
be crying and my chest wanting to
explode or feelings gonna explode. All
that kind of panic attack stuff. But I
would tell myself over and over again
that you did it you went there. Like that
it was a massive thing. And that itself
really helped to over time make it a lot
easier. But I didn't focus on, "Oh, it was a
failure", because it could be measured
as a failure if that's the way you view
it: you couldn't actually stay for the whole
thing. But I measured it as a success that
I actually got there, I left the house,
even though had to come home. Because I
measured it as a sucess, it changed it in my
brain to be okay
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's true.
Something that can also help with this
method is making notes of various
signals. So one thing I would write
in that situation is I made it to the
group. And then you can also measure
how many minutes you managed to be there
until you felt you had to go. And you can
write about other things you could
measure preferably in a quantitative
way. So how many hours I spent in bed
today. Or how many emails or phone calls
I managed to do this week. Things like
that.
Because that way you can objectively see
your development over days and weeks.
And if you don't, you might go through
something that I did over and over, and
that was the negative filter: that
whenever you look back when you're
depressed and look back into your past
you only remember the bad things. When
you look forward into your future you're
pessimistic. So that's that's something
that depression usually does for
you. But then when someone tells you,
"No. Think of all these great things that
you've done or experienced, all these
reasons to be happy," it's not
convincing. But if it comes from yourself
in the in the form of a diary maybe,
then you can't argue with that.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's a very good way. I've never
used that. That's a very sensible
way to...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> There are even apps that will
help you, remind you and ask you these
these questions about how bad or
"From a scale from one to ten how bad was
your anxiety today?" Stuff like that. So
there are ways to help yourself.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Depression and stuff, it takes away hope and it gives
despair. But it's realizing that there is
hope, that there are
ways to get through this. That's
the sort of message I try to tell people.
It's again, it may not feel that way
because it's one of the most patronizing
things to say when you're going through a
depression, is that, "It'll be okay." You're
like at the time it feels like nothing
ever is gonna be okay. But it's like I
think if it's repeated enough I think it
does kind of like hit the subconscious a
little bit maybe and help hopefully. But
just through my own experience
is that getting there it's
tough. But it's so much better than
what it was, and there is so much hope
for the future. I guess, as
culture starts to understand it more as
well (because again we're going through a
process of understanding within
mainstream culture). Another celebrity who
passed away recently, Caroline Flack,
she did reality TV
shows and stuff. And there's been a
massive movement because she
had depression and took her life, and to
try and stop the media and paparazzis
being so cruel and invasive, just getting into people's private
lives and stuff. And there's a lot of
legislation trying move forward, I think,
hopefully soon to make that a thing. So
it's so sad that it
has to be the catalyst is something so
sad as a loss of a life. I wish we could go
through this experience, that the mainstram culture would figure
it out without all this loss. But it
seems to be the way that these things go
at the moment. It takes these things to
the understanding forward, or get it into the
mainstream, that actually we can change
things, and we can get better, and we can
help others. A lot of the
experiences we go through we go
through, somebody will help us those
things will help us and then we'll meet
somebody else that's going through a
similar situation we used to go through
or currently going through and the
wisdom that we have gained can be passed
on.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I remember being afraid of
speaking to anyone because of some
negative experiences I had. And then when
someone did treat me with enough
respect and just humility, not
believing that they could do for me
what I couldn't, I slowly realized, "Okay,
it's not as dangerous as I thought to
put myself out there." Our listeners
can probably tell that we have come a
long way, since we're able to speak in
this way at all.
This wouldn't have been possible several
years ago for me, or just a few years. So
do you ever get angry when you look back
and think, "Oh, so many years of my life
were stolen!"
Or do you somehow manage to incorporate
your experiences in your life and
your story, your identity?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> There are times
when I get angry.
There are times when like I get
frustrated and wish the things could
have been different. But there's just
little moments of again the depression
or like feeling extra down. The majority of
time I see as a positive that I've been
for these experiences. Again at the time
when you go through them it's hell. But
afterwards when you make it and you...
times weren't anything to make it, there
are times when it was so bad that yeah I
nearly I mean I was in mental health
hospital for two months at one point
because it was so bad. But I look back
and a lot of it, in fact all of it,
I wouldn't change. I am who I am today
because of these experiences. And I love who
I am today. It took a long time to get to
that point where I could love myself and
say those kind of things and be positive
about all these things. We give
negative and positive definitions, but
actually they just they just are. It's
part of life, and it's up to us to define
them. I try to own them. I know they
use that term in society a lot these
days. I tried to own the situations
and realize that I can use them for good.
I can use them to benefit my own life,
these experiences, and do better in I
guess my kindness towards people and my
understanding other people. Again that
can connect me to and make those strong
connections and friendships like we have.
And I think yeah there are moments of
frustration and anger. But most of time I
manage to see it as something that it's, just
it is and it's up to me what I do with
it, I guess. How about you?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I have
several thoughts on the topic. I'm trying
to sort them. I think the frustration
and anger with not leading the life
that you wanted
comes from having an ideal picture of
what your life should be like. And where
does actually from? I guess it
comes from comparing myself to others or
the expectations that other people have
for me, and realizing that, "Oh no, it
didn't go that way. So there must be
something wrong with me."
Or, "I must be a bad person." Those are
thoughts that I have from time to time.
And so it helps me not to compare myself
to others. It helps me when I get to know others personally and
realize that everyone has difficulties
and pain, and there is no use in
comparing yourself. I mean there is use
in making measurements for science
and you know becoming aware of what's
going on, obviously. But thinking of
yourself as less valuable than someone
else because they manage to be more
successful with the opposite sex or with
working with money, just establishing
themselves in certain ways that you
would have liked to by a certain age.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Of course, yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's counter-productive.
And so yeah we need to write our own
stories. And mental illness is
part of my story. It's not something that
I'm finally waiting to finish so that I
can resume my story. It is my story. And
it's not all I am. It doesn't
define me in every way. But it is a huge
part of my life. Like you said, I try
to own it.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> That's a perfect sort of
conclusion to end on, I think,
actually because we, as you say, define
ourselves by success of how
we are with women, jobs, where it's not
about that. I would love that. It
would be nice. But it's a journey of
the self. We do this podcast:
"Who am I?" And what you say really just
resonated inside me:
Yeah that's exactly how it is.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So, I
hope we could spread some hope: that
there is some purpose to what we go
through, that it's not all bad, that it
doesn't have to end bad. It has
certainly given me more compassion and
empathy as well. That's a big plus. And we
just don't choose what we go through in
this life. So we might as well be more
open and not hold ourselves to the
expectations we got from somewhere. Thank you. That was a good discussion.
</p>
