Steven lives in Gloucester, England, UK. In his teens he enjoyed philosophical and religious discussions with friends and teachers alike. Absorbing any medium of fictional stories also became a great source of enjoyment, while broadening his perspective through vicarious experience.

His own experiences in life have also led to a great desire to discuss and explore perspectives on any subject. He has found that the moment you think you grasp a situation, or think you know something, the opposite will often take place to obliterate the narrowing nature of thinking in absolutes. One of Steven’s favourite things to talk about is Frank Herbert’s Sci-Fi classic, Dune.

Steven also loves writing his own stories, playing computer games, having simple silly fun with his nieces and nephew, playing DnD and board games with friends, and eating a lot of pizza and ice cream.
