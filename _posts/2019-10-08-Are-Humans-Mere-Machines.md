<p><b>William:</b> Uhm, I have a
different view. I really enjoy the
Australian philosopher David Chalmers on
this topic. And I watched some of the
interviews with him. And I can't say
for certain, obviously, but I like how he
says that no matter how complex machines
get, no matter how many artificial neurons you put together in a network,
you will never achieve the same kind of
consciousness that humans experience. So
he makes a hard difference, a strict
difference between artificial
intelligence and, I guess, natural
intelligence. And so... Sorry?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> The question there
is... because we're machines in
biology. We have electrical
currents going through us. So ultimately we'll just
come full circle, won't we? We will get to
the point where through machine and
biology we just combine the two to be
able to make humans. Is that not...?
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's a popular view. That's right. I'm glad you raised
that and not just go along with what I'm
saying because, yes, a lot of people
believe that we are just a biological
machine.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Ok. Yeah, I don't know what I personally believe, but I'm just throwing in different viewpoints.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> No, it's important that we
mention especially the questions that
a lot of people have. And this is a
common question. What's the name of
the English physicist who died recently?
Hawking, Stephen Hawking. I read...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> He passed away?! Wow. Sorry.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yes. he did, a few years ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh
my goodness. This is hilarious. I'm going to literally look this up
because it's just... this
happens a lot with me.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I
miss a lot of stuff too but...
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, March. Wow, yeah.
Again, okay, with my health stuff, my memory and that. It's, yeah...
I would have... The time I think...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> He was
just on the Big Bang Theory a few years
ago.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Okay, I must have... Obviously I would have seen it. I would
have known that he had passed away. Again.
because of health stuff my memory, it's
just gone.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Information overload? You
can't go away?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I don't know what it was.
My stupid health, he ability to
retain memory at the moment...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Are you
saying that you knew at one point and
forgot?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, well I would have had, it
would been on Facebook or whatever
else I use. So I would have known,
but the problem gets where you tell me, you said, he died.
And I'm like "I can't remember", I'm
like "okay, that sounds right", but there's
no grounding in my brain where I can go.
There is no point of reference.
I remember hearing it at that point.
So I question the reality of it just
for myself, knowing you're right, but not
having any context for myself.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> That's
confusing.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Oh, it can be it can be really difficult
sometimes.
Yeah, there's certain things,
there's no rhyme or reason to
it. Anyway,
off-topic.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> I mentioned Stephen Hawking
because he was very popular. He was
stubborn. But his views had a big
influence on people. Anyway, he said... Every
time he made a new discovery, or in science
in general made a new discovery,
he believed... he felt confirmed, so that
his view became more likely to be true,
which is that we are just matter in
action and there's nothing immaterial
behind it. He likes to say at the end of
an explanation "and since we know now how
this works there is no more need for God".
Because, as you know, one reason that
religion is popular is whenever people
hit a wall with their explainability,
with their knowledge on a topic they
like to say "...and everything beyond that
is up to God".
Since our brains are so, let's go
with finite,, and God's isn't this is
something that he can understand that we
can't. And I think that's true, you know, in
a sense. But I like to think that God can
tell us everything. So therefore
nothing is really unaccessible. It just
might not be in our control. We cannot
always force progress or knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> It's
a way of just saying "etc., etc." or "and so on
and so forth." We have got this point of
knowledge that's as far as we can go at
a specific period of time.
And that's to be able to understand that we
can't understand it yet. We can't assume
it...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> How can we know what we cannot know?
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah, we kind of submit and go "okay, well,
sometimes ignorance is bliss. And we will
get there at some point, but right now we
don't." It's like there has
to be an answer. Why can't it just put "dot dot dot,
and just we'll get there eventually. Give
us time."
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, you know, a Black Swan might
come along. And it wouldn't be a Black
Swan if you expected it. So there are
emergent... there are emergent phenomena
like that where knowledge suddenly makes
a leap
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> But... I forgot how we got onto
the topic.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> Stephen Hawking, at the end
of his statements...
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> So when
scientists or people making discoveries
or even people catching up on already
existing knowledge, you know, knowledge
that is in the human society already,
when they catch up, and this happens to
me too, I start noticing
patterns in nature, and I say "wow this
explanation is really good and explains
this and this and answers this question
I always had", and you get so confident
that you start believing this can
explain everything or it'll just be
another five to ten years until we can
explain everything. And that is not
advisable, not careful.
</p>

<p><b>Steven:</b> I get very
confused by the whole "looking for the
one question that answers everything".
I find it very ignorant and, again,
it's just me being a kind of human
being with not much knowledge of
anything, really. But I find it very
strange because at any given point
something can prove a situation, and then
time goes by, something happens which
contradicts that.
It doesn't change the other thing, it doesn't
change that at that point the proof
that was a certain way... Again, it's proof.
It's not just a theory. Life is contradictory.
It's paradoxical. There is a 
Dune quote. I won't go into it. It
talks about how paradox is just an
entertaining thing. People
that get wound up in paradox need to
chill out. That's the Steven way of
interpreting the quote because
actually paradox is just part of
existence. And so why... and
contradiction... why do we need to suddenly say
that was wrong and now this is
right. We have an obsession with that,
I think, as a species.
</p>

<p><b>William:</b> Yeah, I think the
more humble scientists say that
scientific discoveries are really just
theories, and you can never prove that
they're true. You can just show that
they're true in certain contexts and
certain experiments. And they are assumed
to be true until they're disproven. So
every theory is falsifiable but not
really provable.
They would need to test it in every
possible situation and we don't even
know how to do that. We would need to
know everything about everything to have
absolute certainty about something to be
true. So the theory doesn't just mean
some discovery that meta-scientists
formulated, but also something, like most
people use the word, something not
certain.
