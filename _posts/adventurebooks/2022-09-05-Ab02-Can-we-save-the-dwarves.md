description: In a dark, lethal forest we are comissioned with finding and delivering the dwarves' warhammer to their leader at Stonebridge to the north in order for his army to defeat the troll threat. Is that trust misplaced? Or is it the dwarf's last hope for his people to survive? We encounter many traps on the way, making our endeavour near-impossible.
